i laughed when washington had to make a statement for china not to do this with the us diplomats reminds me of the chappelle skitif anyones going to fuck our citizens its gon na be us the us government,0
im honestly shocked that the rhetoric and actions coming from the us government has been so tame and slow what transpired in the last four years was essentially a nation getting completely and utterly bent over by their former arch enemy with a fraction of its economy and powerthe old soviet leadership would have creamed their collective pants just by managing something equivalent to this cyber attack not even counting everything else,0

this article makes one very outlandish claim namely it states that this rapport could have sweeping implications for ussaudi relationsi dont think there is any chance that this will impact the relations between countries significantly at all in fact i believe it will be business as usual,0
in all fairness i dont think they were including gorillas and lions when they said pets,0
did you know where the worst famine in a lot of time was two years ago thats right it was yemen its just that virtually no outlet reported on it yemen for me devolved into a topic similar to climate change i was once incredibly passionate about it and tried to change that shit but with time i learned i can virtually do nothing in that regard and that everyone around me ignores these issues so one day i just resignated and accepted that we have to deal with the fallout rather than the actual pervading problems i guarantee you yemen will have similar issues in half a decade because they had similar issues half a decade ago,0
reminds me of the first time i ever used amazon to buy some socks the two ads that came up were for minecraft and pvz garden warfare 2 the only 2 games i was really playing at the time kinda freaked me out,0
the way the detective handled it was fascinating he seemed to be trying to make the murderer feel respected and validated without actually agreeing with him which is a great way to handle narcissistic personalities is you want cooperationthe murderer was so matter of fact as if his thought process was clear and obvious the lack of empathy was disturbing,0
so let me get this straight they launched a coup to overthrow the govt without first checking to make sure they had enough money in the bank to weather intl sanctions and isolation,0
while giving her judgment ontario superior court justice anne molloy said she would only refer to minassian as john doe so as not to give him more fame—one of his stated goalsit is my hope that his name would no longer be published by name by anyone else she saidoh vice,0
and no sanctions not even one just wordsa proof that our intervention in lybia iraq and syria has never been about the people because we could have stopped other wars and didn´t do anything because there wasnt any benefit on it even worst we supplied them weapons,0
purely anecdotal but my time spent in the uk left an impression on me that tabloid readership is just much more prominent and their tabloids are even scummier than here in the us i hardly ever see anyone reading a national enquirer but i remember seeing shit loads of people sitting around reading sun daily mail etc again anecdotal personal experience etc,0
of course it is itd be harmless even at several orders of magnitude higher this is nonnews as usual particles from chernobyl and from global nuclear testing are also in your body all the time no matter where you live but this is about as meaningful as those common wow factoids that the water molecules in your body were at one point part of a dinosaur or whatever,0
sounds like it is harmless in these quantities though,0

the article doesnt really say what happened i looked into it and its pretty gruesome the police parents are alleging she tried the tiktok blackout challenge which looks to be some kind of viral challenge to pass out or faint and so this kid tied a belt around her neck could also be suicide but its doubtful i truly do feel sorry for the family kids do some stupid shit,0
poisoned by the people that just put you in prison,0
gt mr pompeo and senior state department officials made the decision just days before mr biden takes office the finding could complicate his administrations dealings with beijingno doubt that was the reason they waited until the very last moment reaping the praise for saying it while offloading the potential economic fallout to the incoming administration,0
i hope he knows what he is doing,0
the video of when it actually happened,0
can anyone that is familiar with the topic explain the ramifications of this,0

well they took the passive aggressive route no need for threat of war just publicly shame your enemy with truth,0

they openly admit they do not care about any valid process arresting people in front of the court not letting people walk througheven the ones who live nearby 2 judge changes 1 resigned 1 refused no audio or video recordings 3 delays during which police came to main squares to prevent people from gathering it feels like everyone knew the outcome but still had a tiny sliver of hope left that judge will follow the law,0
i might add that its illegal for the police to not allow a lawyer to be present following an arrest as per the russian constitution navalny has the right to remain silent and hes a very skilled lawyer himself but to not allow his lawyer who is right there to be present with him is absolutely another violation of the law by putin,0
i hope he is ok and makes it out alive,0
unexpected,0

this is reddit and i know is mostly american so im going to get downvoted but every time usa intervened in another country they had an interest different than help that country to solve their problems and everyone knows that so this only means that theres nothing to win for them there anymore id like to be wrong and id like this was the first step for usa to stop trying to be the god and saviour of the world but that would be very innocent,0

who knew that leaving a trade union would mean you leave a trade union,0
cool but can someone keep an eye on it and make sure its spent honestly,0
you wouldnt get it the moment he decides to stay outside of russia putin has won it would mean that resistance is pointless and that the opposition ends up in exile being depicted as cowards navalny went back and got arrested by dozens of policemen the pictures were made they show how scared the regime is and navalny is sending a message to those opposing it dont be afraid its always worth fightingnavalny has beaten putin psychologically there are so many things that are more important than selfpreservation,0

every time theres an article like this i think back to when sinead oconnor ripped up a pic of the pope and had her career stalled because of it,0
a lot of people who dont understand russian politics here navalny took this risk because he knows that while him being arrested is a given him being dead afterwards is not as likelythere is a reason putin used novichok and not something much simpler like a window suicide navalny is a known opposition leader and putin wanted his death to be a weird mysterious event like who knows what happened maybe bad heart or maybe too much moonshine that would give russian government a plausible deniability for all the wtfs from both the west and their own people its a mistake to think that putin doesnt care about anyones opinion there are still too much of his and his friends economical interests tied up to europe to risk more sanctions also his power is still very much based on popular support which is achieved by propaganda and one of propagandas cornerstones is we are the good guys the west are the bad guys a lot of doubts were already introduced with navalnys poisoning and killing him now basically puts a sign over putins head yes i did it that will add more cracks to an already breaking system that doesnt mean of course that putin cant say fuck it and still flatline the guy and we wont be reading some bad news next week but its far from guaranteed,0
you mean the same bank that supported trump when literally no other bank on earth would touch him and trumps personal deutsch bank rep was the son of supreme court justice anthony kennedy who quietly retired from the bench halfway through trumps term in 2018if so yeah dont worry about it theres nothing to see here trust me,0
they think we have shame that was their first mistake,0
they wont really disconnect its too important to the propaganda and hacker arms of their military they will just ban it from the people,0

yea i posted this above seen multiple xrays of people who had horrid scans in march and by august their lungs were completely clear this is a sensational and misleading article,0
gtshe says patients whove had covid19 symptoms show a severe chest xray every time and those who were asymptomatic show a severe chest xray 70 to 80 of the time there are still people who say im fine i dont have any issues and you pull up their chest xray and they absolutely have a bad chest xray she said in xray photos of a normal lung a smokers lung and a covid19 lung that bankheadkendall shared with cbs dallas the healthy lungs are clean with a lot of black which is mainly air in the smokers lung white lines are indicative of scarring and congestion while the covid lung is filled with whitethat is terrifying for the asymptomatic patients who do not think that they have any problem,0
which goes to show just how contagious covid is considering it infected millions while the flu almost disappeared,0
thats some monkeypaw shit right there some asshole wished for no more flu,0
fucking clickbait canada did not say they will require a vaccine passport,0

erdogan will recognize the united states genocide of native americans and african slaves,0
fun fact an additional contributing factor to no flu this year besides the obvious masks and social distancing is that the flu mutates effectively by traveling along with humans to the southern hemisphere during the norths summer there it mutates and spreads then the new strain variant travels back up to start a new flu season for the norths winter because no one was traveling we didnt have this viral exchange that normal accelerates mutation which helped contribute to the nonexistent flu seasonsource,0
yeah sounds like a winwin to me all genocides should be recognized so that each nation and people can examine the mistakes of their past for the purpose of striving to prevent them in the future,0

i dont think putins ever seriously dealt with a dude whose sole purpose in life and death was to punish him beforemost of the time threats of death work on people and you can easilyish control them through fearbut every once in a while your aggressive domination backfires horrifically and creates a single sick magnificent bastard who just wants you to pay and will gladly toss his life in a furnace if it means fucking you as hard as possible not because he hates you specifically but because you represent to him an intolerable state of existence a future dominated by one man where people are controlled through fear animal husbandry for humanityand this one person putin isnt equipped to handle him he cant kill him now he cant break him he could permanently cripple the guy and turn him into a vegetable and that still wont stop himputin has created the purest most natural nemesis to dictators everywherehes created a psychotically brave man a man wholl stop at nothing to nosale putin for the good of his country even if his own views are misaligned his will cant be questioned nalvany is going to win solely because putin doesnt know how to defeat a man who knows no fear of death or torture,0

hitler and nazism loathed russians and other slavs but there was a special hatred for soviet slavs they were untermenschen some should be kept as slaves and worked to death but most should be immediately killed hitlers plan for moscow was to completely cover and bury it like it never existed auschwitz was originally built and designed to house soviet pows how any russian could shave his head and give the ol sieg heil and think that somehow he is superior and a true nazi defies logic so do german nazis today but the russian skinheads baffle me,0
my greatgrandma fled from smyrna during the great fire she passed away in 2019 im sure that some survivors even a very small percentage are still alive right nowits sad that most turkish people vehemently deny it its even more sad when they make jokes about it we taught greeks how to swim and stuff like thatim not expecting anything to change in the future but seeing people learning more about these atrocities makes me kinda happy,0
one advantage of electing a man whos too old to give a fuck,0

i read the article and the headline is misleading it makes the reader think that japanese firms are going to take action on boycotting but actuallygtthirteen companies excluding panasonic responded each one either denied having direct dealings with the indicated suppliers suspected of using uyghur forced labor or claimed that they could not confirm that suppliers were using forced labor moreover most responded that they would cease to do business with any business partner found to be engaged in human rights violationsgtpanasonic did not respond before the investigations deadline and attempts to reach the company by phone yielded only statements that the question would be passed on to the department in charge panasonic also did not respond to a request for comment by the sankei shimbun on april 15gton the other hand sharp corporation which responded to the survey told the the sankei shimbun on april 15 that in our investigation so far we have been unable to confirm the fact of forced human labor on the part of our suppliers the company went on to add our company policy does not tolerate human rights violations such as forced labor if such facts are later found to be true we will insist that our supplier correct the situation if that fails we will consider measures such as terminating our business dealingsthe word plan doesnt even appear once in the body of the article,0
especially after obama campaigned on it and then reneged to avoid pissing off turkey,0

ive talked to a few japanese exchange students and theyve all said they deserved the nukes they are forced to go to the museums and learn about what they did but just not all of it,0
nobody panics because its all part of the plan,0
its all encoded in the basic reproduction number the r0 of covid is 29 whereas the common flu is 13 and since the spread is exponential over time a small change in r0 has very large effects the measures taken usually remove a fraction from the r0 say school closure reduces r0 by 30 enough to halt the spread of influenza results in r of 09 but not nearly enough for covid results in r of 20,0
fking gross and sick,0
this whole article is disgusting what a fucking loser,0
they claim its was just a war they dont deny killing the armenians but claim the armenians fought back which is just ridiculous because the armenians were vastly outnumbered,0

this number seems suspect most pcrbased covid tests have a reported specificity of 99999 even in a city of 113 million covid negative people a test in the high end of the specificity spectrum 999 would still yield 13000 false positive results the fact that they somehow only got 9 positives and all 9 had severe enough symptoms to require hospitalization is highly unlikely,0

the truth is i was very proisrael for a long time they have a right to defend themselves until now the technical start of the war was reported as hamas firing rockets at israelbut in reality the start was occupation soldiers storming the alaqsa mosque and forcefully clearing out palestinians without any valid reason the palestinians were there celebrating a holiday israel had no business sending in soldiers or whatever they like to call them police but in reality theyre occupation soldiers and they never provided a reason as to why they did it palestine as a whole has absolutely no recourse no legal means of questioning or holding israel accountable for such an outrageous and provocative action so this was the only end result the war was predictable like clockwork before it begannow weve got a ceasefire and what does israel do the exact same goddamn thing,0

lived in korea for the better part of a decade so i can give you my inputthose who get married are expected to have children children are pressured to get married and once they are they are then pressured to have childrenkorea has many of the same issues as most first world countries who fertility rates are decreasing but a few additional ones as well1 stagnant wages wages havent kept up with the cost of living this makes it very difficult for a single person presumably the father to be a breadwinner for their spouse and their children even both spouses working can still not make enough money to afford the cost of living furthermore if both spouses are working theres no one to really take care of the children2 cost of housing cost of housing has exponentially grown over the last decade in korea families cant afford housing while also trying to support a family people cant afford housing that can accommodate a family so they simply dont have children3 gender equality many women in korea no longer want to be the stay at home housewife this means they are much less reluctant to have children who will burden them with staying at home they want financial independence even if married without a parent to remain at home with the children couples dont want to have children this is one of the reasons why a lot of women dont want to get married many are aiming to become a gold miss which is a term for a financially independent older woman4 lack of a support network maternitypaternity leave lack of daycares etc if both parents want to work theres really no one but relativesgrandparents who can help take care of children not everyone has access to this and many dont want to burden their families without providing a safety net parents wont have children5 work life balance working 96 plus overtime 56 days a week is not uncommon in korea this means people who work long hellish hours are less likely to want to go home and then take care of their children or spend money to care for their children they would rather relax and rest and spend that money on ways to help them cope with their work life furthermore many men simply dont want to go home to their spouse and children because of how exhausting their work is so they simply make up an excuse and find a way to relax this only creates more of a burden for the spouse at home some countries have found ways to handle all 5 of these issues with varying levels of success korea has not and they keep trying to combat the symptoms or outright ignoring them instead of dealing with the root of the problemuntil theres a better support network in place in the form of daycare and company support for paternitymaternity leave cheaper housing an increase in wages improving the situation for women in the workplace and improvements in worklife balance the fertility rate will continue to fall then the real problems begin what happens to a society that is too top heavy where there are too many old people who vote and set the policies while no longer contributing to the economy the young then have to shoulder the responsibility for dealing with that issue its not going to be a pretty picture,0

the cynicism in threads like this is both understandable and incredibly disappointing there have been real consequences from the panama papers that are still playing out today its correct that those consequences are a drop in the bucket compared to the scale of global dark money out there and of course it would be naive to celebrate too much but the solution has to start somewhere there is no silver bullet for this worse falling over each other to loudly declare that nothing will happen is actually helping to ensure that nothing will happen in the future youre doing the ultrarichs work for them by prepping yourselves and the rest of us to accept that nothing will change taking pressure off of regulators to do anything this kind of apathy and helpless acceptance is also the goal of oligarchs and authoritarians around the world perhaps most famously putin dont help putini know it feels stoic and brave to play the jaded cynic but not only is it lazy to avoid checking whether the no consequences claim is actually true its actively counterproductive to spread it and i assure you its not the hot take you seem to think we need people to care not to compete with each other to be the most performatively pessimistic i really like this article that explains the problems with naive cynicism which is somewhat old now but still very relevant,0

but no one can force google and facebook to fund the news when given the choice they can just as easily opt to not have news on their platforms at all as we have seen with fb in australia they also could opt to only allow select news sites that are willing to agree to a deal favourable to the social media companies no one can force them to link to all contentas a society we should be deeply alarmed by that without real news getting in the way fake news and conspiracies will flourish more than they already do on fb when your crazy uncle posts the next insane conspiracy theory it might not even be possible to link to a credible source that disproves it making it seem proven to many,0

so ive often posted about being a veteran im not going to dig through my post history but i dont believe ive mentioned all that often if at all about where i was posted or how long i was one of the unlucky few sent on an extended deployment we were in iraq for 15 months while we initially started in baghdad in december of 2007 our battalion was soon sent to mosul from at least january of 2008 through december of 2008 i spent my deployment in mosul apologies as its been a long time and my memories are incomplete at the time and consider i was only a specialiste4 my understanding was that there was a push by the us military to force insurgents north which meant eventually mosul one of the most northern major cities if i recall correctly it was still considered the 2nd biggest city in iraq perhaps the 3rd biggest but the years and my alcoholism have done a number on my memories having only watched the opening so far the city looks far more destroyed than i recall there were parts of the city that i remember being especially beautiful a quick google search shows that the movie plot takes place well after our battalion left i fully intend to watch this movie all the way through im curious to see if i can recognize anything at all from the movie that i remember from my experiences but i can say one thing absolutely i didnt fear isis then and they killed a close friend of mine amongst many others i sure as hell dont fear them now and neither should you,0

theres still seven of them they have a spare raven and they have a raven breeding program the raven breeding program seems to have begun in 2018 and back then they had 7 including the one missing so i suppose maybe the extra one comes from the breeding program why only one though when ravens apparently lay a few eggs at a time when they do who knowsanyway according to that older story about the program the ravens did drop to just 1 guard in ww2 when they were also being used as spotters for bombs and planes during the blitz winston churchill ordering them to keep at least six seems to have worked their kingdoms still around unless you decide the loss of empire counts i guess,0

the helmand river flows entirely in afghanistan its source in the hindu kush and its mouth at wetlands on the afghaniran border in the southwest nimroz it is entirely within afghan jurisdictionalso see thisgtfrom an economic efficiency perspective the ownership of the water is not particularly critical if two countries share the water in a river and one country controls most of the water but the other country has higher value uses of the water the first country will simply trade water to the second country the implication is that cooperation and treaties on international rivers should occur when reallocating water between countries will result in gains in economic efficiency since the 1970s there has been no cooperation instead iran has just been getting water for free outside bounds of agreement because afghanistans gone through long wars,0

this number seems suspect most pcrbased covid tests have a reported specificity of 99999 even in a city of 113 million covid negative people a test in the high end of the specificity spectrum 999 would still yield 13000 false positive results the fact that they somehow only got 9 positives and all 9 had severe enough symptoms to require hospitalization is highly unlikely,0

traced this back the info comes from the russian embassy in afghanistan repeated by an afghan diplomat in tajikistan who hates ghani then tweeted by a bbc reporter finally repeated by yahoo op when asked for evidence the russian spokesman said well we are here,0
its also the region that broke the soviets they launched 9 different major offensives into the valley the 5th and 6th offensives finally took the lower valley at the cost of 3000 soviet casualties but they never really secured it and had to keep sending in offensives to retake it even after that,0
let me guess tomorrow it would be kabul,0
they managed to take over the city before i finished my laundry,0
at least bush and cheney are still around to see the taliban capture kabul on the 20th anniversary of 911,0
i wonder how strongly worded their letter will be,0
haiti cant catch a break,0
i hope the gone missing is theyre missing as theyve gone underground to escape across the border and not snapped up by the taliban,0

us predictions counted on afghan troops fighting back to buy just enough time for us to leave turns out the army didnt want to die just just to buy the us time,0
having a top official there will also somehow deter the talibans from going wild in kabul anything happens to him will probably ensure a swift retaliation from uk he is leveraging on this to help as many as possible,0

ie were excellent judges of morality i say we need to sexually assault recruits to make sure theyre not immoral,0
dont forget the part where the taliban is capturing humvees and western armaments so after 20 years we succeeded in overturning the stagnant taliban leadership making room for more radical younger leadership and providing them westernbuilt munitions instead of sovietbloc munitions i guess well see what the chinese do with the place,0
i mean i imagine they also thought the afghan army would fight back just for the sake of preventing the taliban from taking control of their country turns out they didnt want to die for that either,0

there is no collective identity there is only the disparity between urban and rural nationbuilding is hard work and doing it within predetermined lines which have never taken the people they surround into consideration turns an uphill battle into a cliffscaling struggle others can give a fledgling nation all the labels they want but for aspiring states like kabul if you want to unite the surrounding area which already has various concentrated power bases then youre starting with a feudal society,0

of course netanyahu will reject the truce offer he has to keep this up till the deadline of 28 days for opposition parties to strike a coalition deal and form a new israeli government passes antinetanyahu coalition talks got suspended since raam is affiliated ideologically with hamas and abbas could not afford to sign coalition deals with israel while government forces were clashing with his brothers in gaza raam officials have said that until the violence stops the negotiations would not resume all netanyahu has to do is keep up the clashes with hamas for 3 more weeks to torpedo the formation of a unity government and force a fifth election the heightened sentiments the rally round the flag effect will ensure that netanyahu easily wins the election this time,0
i honestly think its a sensible if controversial decision the olympics would devolve into a gradeschool brawl if there wasnt a blanket ban on political messaging imagine if the iranian team wore shirts calling americans invaders and terrorists the north koreans proclaiming unification is inevitable the ukrainians calling the russians out for annexing crimea the israelis getting accused of genocide the list goes on and on the olympics will simply become a platform where domestic or regional greivances get aired for the world to see itd just become the un but without the processes and bureaucracy to regulate and channel the undying rage some nations or groups hold against each other,0

the fact theywe have to say it makes baby giraffes cry,0
what would a full scale war even look like i have to imagine if israel really went all in the palestinian resistance would be crushed pretty fast their only hope would be to basically to hope for a insurgency after they lose the thing i probably understand the least of all this is what hamas long term plan is in all this they have no path to victory,0

the truth is i was very proisrael for a long time they have a right to defend themselves until now the technical start of the war was reported as hamas firing rockets at israelbut in reality the start was occupation soldiers storming the alaqsa mosque and forcefully clearing out palestinians without any valid reason the palestinians were there celebrating a holiday israel had no business sending in soldiers or whatever they like to call them police but in reality theyre occupation soldiers and they never provided a reason as to why they did it palestine as a whole has absolutely no recourse no legal means of questioning or holding israel accountable for such an outrageous and provocative action so this was the only end result the war was predictable like clockwork before it begannow weve got a ceasefire and what does israel do the exact same goddamn thing,0

lived in korea for the better part of a decade so i can give you my inputthose who get married are expected to have children children are pressured to get married and once they are they are then pressured to have childrenkorea has many of the same issues as most first world countries who fertility rates are decreasing but a few additional ones as well1 stagnant wages wages havent kept up with the cost of living this makes it very difficult for a single person presumably the father to be a breadwinner for their spouse and their children even both spouses working can still not make enough money to afford the cost of living furthermore if both spouses are working theres no one to really take care of the children2 cost of housing cost of housing has exponentially grown over the last decade in korea families cant afford housing while also trying to support a family people cant afford housing that can accommodate a family so they simply dont have children3 gender equality many women in korea no longer want to be the stay at home housewife this means they are much less reluctant to have children who will burden them with staying at home they want financial independence even if married without a parent to remain at home with the children couples dont want to have children this is one of the reasons why a lot of women dont want to get married many are aiming to become a gold miss which is a term for a financially independent older woman4 lack of a support network maternitypaternity leave lack of daycares etc if both parents want to work theres really no one but relativesgrandparents who can help take care of children not everyone has access to this and many dont want to burden their families without providing a safety net parents wont have children5 work life balance working 96 plus overtime 56 days a week is not uncommon in korea this means people who work long hellish hours are less likely to want to go home and then take care of their children or spend money to care for their children they would rather relax and rest and spend that money on ways to help them cope with their work life furthermore many men simply dont want to go home to their spouse and children because of how exhausting their work is so they simply make up an excuse and find a way to relax this only creates more of a burden for the spouse at home some countries have found ways to handle all 5 of these issues with varying levels of success korea has not and they keep trying to combat the symptoms or outright ignoring them instead of dealing with the root of the problemuntil theres a better support network in place in the form of daycare and company support for paternitymaternity leave cheaper housing an increase in wages improving the situation for women in the workplace and improvements in worklife balance the fertility rate will continue to fall then the real problems begin what happens to a society that is too top heavy where there are too many old people who vote and set the policies while no longer contributing to the economy the young then have to shoulder the responsibility for dealing with that issue its not going to be a pretty picture,0

the cynicism in threads like this is both understandable and incredibly disappointing there have been real consequences from the panama papers that are still playing out today its correct that those consequences are a drop in the bucket compared to the scale of global dark money out there and of course it would be naive to celebrate too much but the solution has to start somewhere there is no silver bullet for this worse falling over each other to loudly declare that nothing will happen is actually helping to ensure that nothing will happen in the future youre doing the ultrarichs work for them by prepping yourselves and the rest of us to accept that nothing will change taking pressure off of regulators to do anything this kind of apathy and helpless acceptance is also the goal of oligarchs and authoritarians around the world perhaps most famously putin dont help putini know it feels stoic and brave to play the jaded cynic but not only is it lazy to avoid checking whether the no consequences claim is actually true its actively counterproductive to spread it and i assure you its not the hot take you seem to think we need people to care not to compete with each other to be the most performatively pessimistic i really like this article that explains the problems with naive cynicism which is somewhat old now but still very relevant,0

its often a last gasp attempt to prevent hyperinflation it doesnt often end well because the horse has well and truly bolted by the point a government does thisimagine you own a business in afghanistan you are selling goods worth 10 each around 1000af you have two customers one has a 10 bill and the other a 1000af bill youd take the 10 over the 1000af because its less likely to suddenly lose its value a customer with the native currency would have to pay more than the dollar customer to convince someone to take it this leads to inflation it literally is inflation in action more inflation leads to less confidence so the afghani customer has to pay even more to convince someone to take it which leads to more inflation repeat in a spiral until the currency collapses entirely removing foreign currency from the equation should slow this down as theres no guarantee youd be able to spend or bank your safe dollars hardly ever works though and is extremely difficult to enforce,0

israel threatens the iranian nuclear program and not the entire country which is a result of iran constantly swearing that they will completely destroy iran and about the genocide part could you point to where the un stated that even then that genocide statement would be very dumb because the palestinians are still there and their population is only increasing what israel does could maximum amount up to ethnic cleansing which isnt genocide but a broader term which also includes ethnic displacement about the israeli wmd israel was a tiny country that constantly had to face 4 countries alone which are way bigger than israel so had to develop it as a deterrent what i also find ironic is how western leftists are so opposed about israel doing anything to the iranian nuclear program but they are probably the same people that panicked due to north korean nukes,0

sorry but that is simply not true after wwii there were exactly two conditions for a new german constitution that it should be democratic and a republic how germany archived that was up to its own you can trace the german governmental and political system back to the constitution of the pauls chruch and the weimar republic the coalition system was taken over from weimar and only amended with the 5 hurdle for a party to take to enter the german parliament in order to prevent a fractured parliament as it was seen in weimarwhen the constitution was crafted it was given to the allied forces for approval and it was approved without any demand to change it,0

and thats how the feedback loop works when moderation is either weak or outright in support of hate the end result is decent people filter outyou see the same thing in online games without moderated voice chat think of pubg lobbiesyou see the same thing in discord groupsshit people are vocal and persistent and so long as they live in a world without consequence they absolutely feed on the ability to spread their shitdecent people dont want to deal with that no good person is going to want to spend their entire goddamn afternoon again and again and again arguing the same do these people deserve to be treated as humans bullshit it ruins your day its not a fun word gameand so one after another quietly and with no fanfare they filter outso instead of 100 good people in 10 bad people suddenly its 9010 and then 8010 as it gets more and more concentrated the problem gets worse and lack of pushback only amplifies shit worseive watched many communities die this way especially the ones who buy into the lie that moderation is antifree speech god damn they got people to drink the koolaid on that one and this doesnt just apply to this one subreddit it applies to social media as a whole decent people dont want to deal with it so they are either walling themselves off from shit people in isolated communities shit people tend to mock these as hugboxes or echo chambers when they cant control them or theyre just straight up leaving social media reddits getting worse as wellover the last few months ive been trying on and off to just stop using the website for a few days at a time and you know what i honestly feel a lot betterim pretty close to just deleting the stupid thing and being done with it and thatll be one less person disagreeing with the next hateful post,0

dont worry we have some great climate imitative goals set for 2050 why act with any urgency,0
i can tell by the comments that most people didnt even read the article,0
i heard a conspiracy theory that the vaccine is actually a sterilization campaign to mitigate climate change i knew it couldnt be true because our leaders would never do anything useful about climate change,0
i heard on the radio this morning that the uk intelligence services had sent a warning to the us that they had reason to believe there was going to be a terrorist attack at kabuls airportthings seem to be happening pretty fast in afghanistan,0
bbc said on the 1pm news that this was likely to happen gave an intelligence report pretty much stating exactly what has happened,0
i have to imagine the taliban is pissed as hell about this all they had to do was not have any americans die for like 6 more days and all us troops would be gone and then the taliban could be as tyrannical as they please i bet the taliban had to be super strict with their soldiers about not attacking americans and then isis leroy jenkins the gate and poking the bear as it was on its way out the door i cant imagine the us is just going to ignore it and keep to their exit time table,0
us and the taliban form unlikely team up to defeat isiswhere is carrie matheson when you need her,0
i would be more shocked to learn that the cia didnt meet the taliban to be honest this is the cias job its not like the taliban is a some mysterious organization,0
they all should be tried in criminal court,0

for the lazy and the liars article states they will not fly into afghanistan but rather help with the operations outside afghanistan in places where people are trapped at us bases such as qatar most likely to help with the processing at these chokepoints so they can intake further people from afghanistan,0
how considerate of them,0
taliban and isis have big theological and ideological differences theyve been fighting each other for as long as isis has existed there was an ama thread by a guy who used to fight for the taliban and various other jihadist movements before becoming an atheist who explained it,0
the real global war on terrorism was the friends we made along the way,0
its weird how radical muslims like the taliban are so hardline on covering women to protect their dignity yet they are the biggest offenders when it comes to taking away those womens dignity,0
unfortunately the only australian who deployed in afghanistan likely to face charges is the whistleblower,0

i do not wish to remain in this uncomfortable position where i must choose between placid relations with colleagues on the one hand and the necessity of speaking the truth during a public health crisis on the otherontario needs a public health system that is arms length from politicsand people are wondering why theres so much hesitancy with just about everything,0

its a secret meeting in a sense that public cant know what happened there and there is no media briefing regarding it hence it will stay hidden until at least one of the two parties reveals what happened,0
with all the news that the biden administration was negotiating more time for evacuations how the hell did people think the meetings were happeningof course the cia met with taliban officials its been in the news for 2 weeks,0
the keep calling her oklahoma mom like shes some oil and gas housewife with a hobby when shes a harvard graduate who went to julliard for piano and worked for nasa and has an olympic training centerfeels off,0
so basically were at the civil war stage,0
exactly william burns is one of the few career ambassadors to come out of the foreign service 63 since 1956 so it makes sense even if he wasnt the head of the cia he would have a hand in these negotiationshis nickname is the white houses secret diplomatic weapon seriouslythere is no controversy here just a very skilled diplomat doing his job,0
our current federal government are big bags of shit and 90 of our media is owned by former members of the same political party or murdoch so they get away with basically everythingthe pm scott morrison is a happy clapper and allround shitweasel and our minister of defense previously minister of home affairs peter dutton is generally compared to voldemort for both his appearance and general policy choices,0
isis would love to make the taliban look incompetent and incapable of maintaining order expect a lot more of this very soon,0

arnie continues to go up in my estimation,0
seems like the other ethnic groups tajiks uzbeks and hazarans primarily could take over a few districts where they hold the majority and then the taliban are fighting a war against guerrillas in afghanistan,0

redcon1 sounds like such a great company gt redcon1 a sports supplement company announced last week they were pulling out from sponsoring next months arnold classic bodybuilding competition over schwarzeneggers dangerous and antiamerican commentsgt although singerman said redcon1 has been a sponsor of the arnold classic for nearly a decade the founder said his company is a patriotic profreedom brand that supports freedom of choicegt anyone who says screw your freedoms is unamerican singerman said maybe he shouldnt just cherry pick what schwarzenegger saidgt there is a virus here it kills people and the only way we prevent it is get vaccinated wear masks do social distancing washing your hands all the time and not just to think about ‘ well my freedom is being kind of disturbed here no screw your freedom schwarzenegger saidgt he added you have the freedom to wear no mask — but you know something youre a schmuck for not wearing a mask because you are supposed to protect your fellow americans around youso yeah this isnt about freedoms as much as the company is just some patriotic and profreedom brand which means that they are indeed just schmucks buying into the politicized view of being antieverything in measures to help curb covid i would say that true patriots dont let an epidemic continue because they somehow were told to take a stand against masks and vaccines,0
relevant story from earlier today gt james heappey told sky news that the grim reality is that military intelligence is becoming ever more certain that a terror attack could take place at hamid karzai international airport or the handling centres being used to assess refugeesgtasked whether the attack could happen within the next few hours he replied yesgthis warning comes after the us uk and australia warned people not to travel to the airport due to the rising risk of an attack by local isis affiliate the islamic statekhorasan province iskp a senior british source told the broadcaster there is a very high risk of a terrorist attack against the kabul airlift operation,0

i think its safe to say what was said if you attempt to attack americans or those we are evacuating that we will bomb the living shit out of youim sure there was also a good faith gesture to allow the taliban leader to feel he got a win but id suspect the overall tone was we will come back in and bomb the fuck out of your new found assetsthe taliban now has shit to lose,0

yeah i read one thing that was talking about how a lot of afghanians dont care about what some international community decided was the borders of a country they dont see themselves as afghanistans they see themselves as such and such ethnic group and thats one reason why the military was largely completely ineffective in throwing off the taliban because the military which was largely one ethnic group isnt going to lift a finger to defend these other ethnic groups because they dont see themselves as the same people they see themselves as separate ethnic groups,0

yeah saying youre buying apps from apple when you buy through the app store is like saying youre buying goods from discover when you pay with a discover card the entire amount of the transaction is going through discover but its the merchants money not a commission discover pays to the merchant im not sure theres any real distinction in practice but describing the sale as having been made by discover gives a very distorted impression of the role each party plays in the transaction,0

its bubble wealth they just appear rich on paper which makes banks give them any loan they want if i have 100k and invest it in the stock market i gave those 100k to someone else but its like i still own 100k i practically created new money out of thin air other investors driving up the prices might make my 100k investment appear to be worth 200k soon after am i now 200k rich or are the people who bought 200k worth of stock 200k poorer but according to their portfolio they are still worth 200k even though they said good bye to their 200k i could say im 200k worth now but id only truly have those 200k once i sell all my stock but for that i need to find buyers for that price now people who love to defend the super rich like to say the rich arent rich they dont really have money their wealth is bound in assets in equity sure enough if they all were to sell at the same time the value of their assets would take a nose dive however they are either playing us while laughing up their sleeves or they really buy into that bullcrap the rich are still rich they are evaluated at those prices banks give loans according to that and they can just live on an infinite money maker assuming they dont play the game like an idiot they inflate prices for the rest of us and pocket the increase the ones paying for all of it is the rest of us when someone buys a house for half a million and then sells it for a million we are the ones expected to pay the difference and make the wealthy richer when someone buy a house and rents it out we are expected to pay off their mortgages the stuff we can afford loses its value but the rich buy stuff witch they sell to a higher price they are draining our workforce what we earn goes into their pocket but it doesnt stop there other investors eg crypto investors are the reason that hardware and electricity is becoming more and more expensive businesses that are in the stock market seem to care more for their investors than their own employees,0

the news media should be paying fb for the free advertising and referralsi think government are conflating different issues regulating and taxing tech giants is not the same thing is saving journalism from its death spiral,0

nah they are just smart give in to the media companies demands and they will probably cover your campaign a little nicer next time,0
i dont get how you can ask facebook to pay for content uploaded by otherswhat happens if one site decides to upload every si for news story in its archivei mean free money righti expect some control over that but still the point is clear cant blame facebook for not wanting that to happenfor once facebook dont seem to be the bad guy here,0
i want to charge you why cant i you read this comment its a business decision my content is not free,0

in my opinion the term islamogauchisme islamoleftist is a chimera used by the government to justify and support some of the laws theyre trying to pushhowever denying that there isnt a problem in french universities wont help solve a real problem that is emerging even though its led by a tiny minority of people the rising of an other form of extremism intolerance and censorship set by pressuring people and universities that could in france be assimilated to the american woke movementi cant really say if its a reaction against the emergence of for example la cocarde étudiante a really far right student syndicate or the need to react the wrong way in my opinion against the sometimes too common discriminations minority students can suffer from,0

not sure why hes being downvoted except maybe some people not really catching on to his point might be a difficult topic to discuss too in the us cause of recent events hes not wrong though while there are examples of peaceful rebellions and protests somewhat working a lot of them came with casualities on the rebels side so id challenge the overall peaceful label alltogether most sucessfull revolutions rebellions and protests in the vast majority of our history were not really peaceful at all thats been more of a thing happening since the later half of the previous centuryas a general rule of thumb as long as people in power strive and are able to uphold the status quo you cant use the systems power to change the system itself as you wont be able to sidestep those who need things not to change this holds true for most western democracies too btw if you really wanted things to change on a large scale just voting wont work as politicians wont cut off their own legs no matter their political affiliation just to accomodate the people,0

its not just saying them to pay for showing the news articles as i understand it fb is full of fake and trash news these days so doing so at least make fb set up a vetting system to decide which news sources to be trusted and shown on the news feed this in the end give us reliable news on the feed not random loaded racy and biased news that we are hammered all day,0

is this not similar to youtube videos driving traffic to youtube though im super dumb when it comes to all this if news sites drive traffic to facebook because thats where people go to read headlines isnt that similar to youtube and on youtube videos are paid i see your arguement that news websites get 30 of their volume from facebook but what would it be like if facebook wasnt the front page of the news would that 30 just disappear or would they go searching for the news themselves,0
mars nazi robots,0
your first point isnt entirely correct id bet almost anything most media outlets would prefer readersviewers would come straight to their sites and that they would get all the ad revenue this doesnt happen anymore in fact most of them are obligated to use facebook because its simply the easiest way to get tons of readers quickly and relatively inexpensively because not many people go out of their way for news instead people want things delivered to them even if they didnt ask for it its a truly extraordinary dichotomy on one side murdoch stands to benefit enormously if social media is forced to pay for good journalism but on the other social media who are not bound by journalistic guidelines avoid gst and lots of tax altogether can hijack a news article and the users data and ad revenue it feeds the thing which is really killing us is the staunch partistianship why cant they reach a compromise as in both the government and social media shame on the government for fighting all murdochs way and shame on facebook for taking the bat and ball and going home good luck everyone,0

should be read as canada wants to be the next country where facebook no longer lets users publish newspoliticians and their lobbies are such idiots companies like facebook and google drive the new business and they somehow think its smart to bite the hand that feeds them once they succeed and get them to pull out news from their platforms theyll be even worse off,0

im confused what if the facebook user himself shares a link to the news does this not mean fake or alternative news and stories still be circulated and if that person uses the link to that particular site doesnt that site get ad revenue anyway not a news or gossip junkie so all of this is literally mind boggling for me im also not on fb or whatsapp or insta sadly i still have difficulty with verifying all that i read these days anyway cheers,0
2 important notes1 life existing or having existed on two planets in our solar system tells us literally nothing about how common life is in the universe so far we only have a samplesize of 1 solarsystem out of billions nothign can be concluded out of that2 even if it did imply that traces of past andor present life is common on goldilocks planets we would only know that past andor present life is a common occurance on goldilocks planets this doesnt mean it is common for life to exist long enough to form advanced civilisations just that it would be common that early stages of life developin short no finding traces of past andor present life on mars would be far from the most horrifying thing we ever discovered up until this day unless said life turns out to have been really advanced which is extremely unlikely,0

liberals and murdoch they are dead set on torpedoing this country for a quick buck whatever it takes,0
the amp aspect of it is subject to a separate negotiation nowi would argue that just reading a headline doesnt meaningfully count as consuming a media outlets content newspapers put up posters outside newsagents screaming out their own headlines as a way to get people to buy the actual paper so the headline itself is not exactly a product that needs to be exchanged for money you cant really even know that a news article even exists without its headline so how can a person decide to pay to read it without at least knowing what it contains,0
gtthats basically what happened in australia the other day nonsense laws were passed facebook said no thanks and blocked all news content and newsgov havent stopped bitching about it sincei dont know if this ever reached the anglophone world but germany did this 2013 it was called leistungsschutzrecht für presseverleger but it was more targeted at google claiming they steal news content and therefore need to pay a fee nevermind the fact that you could always deactivate the preview of your articles in search engines or even remove yourself entirely out of the google search but that obviously wasnt the goal they wanted moneywhat did google rightfully do they said fuck you and didnt show them at all anymore axelspringer basically our murdoch press equivalent then suddenly noticed a dramatic drop in views and told google they wont expect money from themthe ecj forced germany to overturn the law completely because they didnt follow proper procedure with eu bodies apparely you have to notify and submit a draft if you create laws around information society services and they didnt do that,0
not just news though no idea if it has been fixed yet but plenty of government sites and charities were blocked as well which no matter what you think about the law is not the best thing to do in the middle of a pandemic and right before the government starts vaccinatinganother little bit of nuance which is what i have mostly seen addressed in my social media bubble is that a facebook apparently can easily block anything they like but apparently has decided against it in the past and b considering the above then why did facebook not do this when we know and they admit to it that their platform was used to help perpetrate genocide in myanmar i dont think the above justify the law in australia but facebooks response must be seen in that context however if facebook can simply just leave a country andor block specific content in a country why would they not do it when their platform was being used for genocide,0
dont worry i got you,0
thank you for saying it idk why people think that breaking them up will lead to competition especially google who uses any search engine other than google ya theyll be the off ones here and there but really everyone uses google same goes for facebook you either have a facebook or dont if you dont i dont see you joininga separate social media site just to stick it to facebook and if you stay on facebook why would you make another social media page when you have facebook,0

they didnt have a forced arbitration clausewhere google cant say no and have to pay whatever the 3rd party says,0
because they have a complete monopoly on advertising why would an advertiser ever go to the news site when he can just use facebooks platform the answer is they wouldnt and they dont so you have a choice either let facebook become more powerful than your government or cut their dick off australia chose to cut their dick off,0

generally cities that dont impose limits on taxis get much worse congestion reducing the ability for people to move around and making the situation worse for everyone which also results in a lot of socioeconomic losses making everybodys commute just five minutes longer will result in billions of dollars of socioeconomic losses every year in a mediumsized cityletting the free market decide is not a good idea in this case,0
except theres actually no penalties for not reaching their goals its useless,0
how if i email you my newsletter and force you to pay for it even though i emailed you it that is exactly what this law does news companies put their own links on facebooks site and now want facebook to be forced to compensate them as evil as facebook is this law is idiotic in every sense no wonder australia has no relevant global companies no internal tech sector etc because they regulate and kill everything now they rely on china and american tech companies,0
but no one can force google and facebook to fund the news when given the choice they can just as easily opt to not have news on their platforms at all as we have seen with fb in australia they also could opt to only allow select news sites that are willing to agree to a deal favourable to the social media companies no one can force them to link to all contentas a society we should be deeply alarmed by that without real news getting in the way fake news and conspiracies will flourish more than they already do on fb when your crazy uncle posts the next insane conspiracy theory it might not even be possible to link to a credible source that disproves it making it seem proven to many,0

good quality journalism comes from journalists with balls and integrity they deserve to paid more yes but im saying that guaranteeing more pay for journalists in general is going to attract more shitty journalists who see it as easy moneyto the second half of your point i think this solution is too simplistic and too libertarian to be viable like okay in principle yes content creators should get paid for their workbut this isnt even the problem with fb reddit etc these platforms drive traffic to those websites for free wsj doesnt pay facebook to send them 10k visitors a month every time some rando user links to a wsj article id argue thats already a pretty fair arrangementnow we force fb to start paying what does fb do the aussies already found out they block news links so now users cant link the things they want wsj gets less traffic users start to look for other platforms and fb traffic drops sites like reddit that are already barely in the black lose one of the biggest attractions to their site and maybe even go out of business as all these ancillary platforms go down or simply stop linking to wsj wsj sees its own traffic drop too because anyone sharing their articles has to pay to do so and a lot of places simply cant afford it or wont good job youve nearly killed online newsoh and the places can and will pay theyre probably profitable enough to get eaten by the same media corps that are pushing this legislation welcome to redditr by fox newstm and then well wonder why its fair that fn articles are free to view on reddit but nyt isnt and we were worried about losing free journalism—guess we dont need to do that anymorethis solution neither fixes the problem nor shows any awareness of how things are already working its the same kind of shortsighted economic thinking that drove sears nearly out of business and motivated brexit leave voters,0

what i dont understand is that there is an obvious downside social media companies will opt to just not let the content be shared and the media companies will lose massive amounts of traffic and as revenue while its true that a lot of people would read the news on fb and never visit the source site its also true that some portion of people would visit the source and now those people will not even get the choice did this really not occur to any of the media companiesits completely bizarre to me that the media companies just assume fb will roll over and happily hand them cash fb doesnt need the media companies and it really doesnt lose much if it blocks content from the media companies its life blood is fake news and other low quality content and that will continue to flourish and even enjoy a wider audience without high quality news content getting in the way which we should all be absolutely terrified by,0

so silly to try calling out the percentage in the title as being false when it actually does represent the actual increase in reports the reports being low doesnt make the percentage less valid because it is a 7time increase in reports if something is usually being reported 10 times annually and then suddenly one year it increases to close to 100 it becomes noteworthy,0

cotton is indeed a very difficult crop in terms of where it can be actually produced and harvested its very water intensive and grows in warm regions onlyits also a crop that has been historically very labour intensive theres a reason why slavery was practiced for so long in the southern us in the cotton fields when there were no cotton picking machines out yetconveniently the us has a really ideal geographic situation in the south to this date making cotton crops a big thing to be produced there the us is still the worlds 2nd3rd largest cotton producer in the world thus making china a competitor and the whole us argument a bit of a conflict of interest the us subsidises cotton farmers by a lot and china is undercutting them making it a political problem where jobs and markets are concerned especially for republicans because they govern the states where the us cotton producers generally liealso ironically speaking of forced labour with this whole thing the us to this day is one of a handful countries that has not ratified the ilo forced labour convention of 1930the other mentionable countries are south korea afghanistan and china,0

conservatism in france hold my glass of red wine,0
i mean that sounds easy to say but very hard to correct because its going to start to hit you and then you feel uncomfortablethats the whole meaning of national interest isnt it countries want their own people ie you to have better living conditions want their own industries to excell and dominate the market but there are only a finite amount of resources available and historically most of those resources are in other countries so there is a fight for resources ongoinghaving a chocolate croissant even if you are just poorly paid cashier having the freedom to go to a store and pick and choose your bakery ingredients like vanilla for the weekend and hot coffee every morning is the standard you want to keep or notthus the exploitative relationship of this system is born and we all rely on it because nobody wants their countries to tell them that you specifically are going to get worse living conditions from now on just for some abstract idea of bad labour practices 3000 miles awayin light of this i always find these discussions about supposedly moral rights highly dubious its always about the interests first and if people would talk about it all in terms of pure interest and find ways forwards from there i would like it more than these highly dubious moral viewpoints where theres going to be tons of hypocritical things,0
gtconservatism is not compatible with the future we facethats because conservatism isnt about the future or even the present its about going back to the past people wearing rosetinted glasses remember the past fondly when men were men women were women homosexuals were beaten up blacks were excluded from society and anyone who promoted socialism would get locked uptheres a reason why conservative politicians are almost always from socioeconomicethnic groups that have traditionally held the most power in society and have been seeing that power erode over the years their campaigns are based on telling people from the same socioeconomicethnic group as them that others or lessers are coming to take away their privilege and they figure that if they lose it theyll be treated by others the same way theyve treated those same others in the past because they also tend to believe in retributive justice,0

cotton farming in the uzbekistan also faces allegations of forced labor and has effectively destroyed the aral sea the soviets set up cotton farms in central asia in order to have some nonwestern production the main other areas of cotton production are the us and india effectively all the water that was needed for the aral sea was diverted and as a result the sea dried up i believe that cotton requires a lot of sun and a decent amount of water so the locations on earth that it can grow are kind of limited if someone knows more about why you cant just grow cotton anywhere feel free to chime in,0

as much as i understand some peoples desire and reasoning for wanting to get rid of nuclear weapons i feel like it would be a disastrous move because we would return to the days where major powers could go to war again without any strong deterrent the us and china may have very well had a war by now if it werent for nuclear weapons,0
no country is going to give up its nukes gaddafi gave up wmd and look at what happened to himrussiaus will never ever give up its nukes no matter what the only thing stopping an all out war between indiapakchina are their nukes israel says it doesnt have nukes but they most certainly do and will never give up due to their neighbours the only reason anyone even listens to nk is due to their nukes well france and uk are the only countries who arent really pointing their nukes at someone but why would they go first,0
and the uk and france and india and pakistan and north korea and israelwhy do people think only russia china and the us have nukes,0
theres still seven of them they have a spare raven and they have a raven breeding program the raven breeding program seems to have begun in 2018 and back then they had 7 including the one missing so i suppose maybe the extra one comes from the breeding program why only one though when ravens apparently lay a few eggs at a time when they do who knowsanyway according to that older story about the program the ravens did drop to just 1 guard in ww2 when they were also being used as spotters for bombs and planes during the blitz winston churchill ordering them to keep at least six seems to have worked their kingdoms still around unless you decide the loss of empire counts i guess,0

it never happened ever in the history of pandemics the period after the vaccine was found was also the easiest during past pandemics in 1918 in 1957 and in 1968 the vaccine reaaally lessened the impacts of those pandemic yeah even in 1918 where they though it was a bacterial strain and therefore were immunizing for the wrong thing even then it had a favourable impact because it stopped a lot of the secondary infections which were often the ones that were making the spanish flu so very deadlyhate such click baity titles they literally ignore the whole of medical history infections always peak around the time that a vaccine is deployed and relatively soon after they crash hard remeber even partial immunity can and will wreak havoc to the virus transmission methods especially if enough people have it either by having had the virus and therefore by antibodies or by having had even 1 of the two doses of the vaccine in fact mass vaccination programs make a huge and swift impact to the epidemiological picture of the virus it makes absolutely no sense to think that 2021 would be tougher than 2020 on the epidemiological front wow,0

the virus needs to enter the respiratory system or mucus membranes in the eyes nose or mouth to cause an infection usually spreads through respiratory droplets from nearby people and entering your body through these routes if the respiratory droplets are actually ingested through food without this type of contact the digestive system will break down the virus into particles and it wont enter the respiratory system while theoretically possible for it to enter mucus membranes in the mouth from food the evidence seems to suggest spread from food in this way is very uncommon,0

one common misconception is that outer space is cold but in truth space itself has no temperature in thermodynamic terms temperature is a function of heat energy in a given amount of matter and space by definition has no mass furthermore heat transfer can not occur the same way in space since two of the three methods of heat transfer conduction and convection can not occur without matterwhat does this mean for a person in space without a spacesuit because thermal radiation the heat of the stove that you can feel from a distance or from the suns rays becomes the predominant process for heat transfer one might feel slightly warm if directly exposed to the suns radiation or slightly cool if shaded from sunlight where the persons own body will radiate away heat even if you were dropped off in deep space where a thermometer might read 27 kelvin 455°f the temperature of the cosmic microwave background leftover from the big bang that permeates the universe you would not instantly freeze because heat transfer can not occur as rapidly by radiation alone source harvard,0

if there was video documented hard evidence of a genocide there would be no need to inspect what you have are annecdotal witness accounts and realpolitik driven narratives by certain groups epoch times rfa hong kong democracy movement xiajing sepratist movements etcthis situation is not vastly different than the iraq wmd situation what you have are unsubstantiated reports and realpolitik hiding the actual motive justifying actions against a country up to an actual invasion in order to secure resourcesestablish controlled governmentcripple and destablize region for geopolitical purposes etc the wmd evidence was not stretching the truth there were no wmds the xianjing region is much the same as of right now there is no video evidence of rape let alone systemic rape no evidence of executions let alone mass executions no evidence of mass children seperation let alone forced family mixing there is no hard or even implied evidence of an actual genocide what you have is an authoritarian regime acting like a bunch of defensive dicks because they decide to unjustly reeducated a large group of antiestablishment individuals who for the most part wish death on the local majority and minority groupsjust because chinas doing it in a shitty way doesnt make it a genocide theres no killing breeding or forced mixing what there is is a slow march of demographics on a region it really is no different than the boiling pot ethnic demands of immigrants that come to canadauseujapanaus etc china wants the ughyrs to blend into the vast diaspora culturally which is really no different then the demands placed on immigrants by western nations the way they are doing it is real questionable given the work camps and reeducation centres but these are little different than the pseudoslave system present in the us for latin american immigrants and the requirement for minorities to prove their loyalties to america via service language appreciation for american culture intermixing etcso unless theres evidence of the factors to show an actual genocide cultural genocide or whatever watered down version of genocide america and the rest of the west needs to justify starting up a proxy war actual or trade with china i would say let the un in to see the un is an organization pulled in many directions by the us by the emea by china by russia by eu etc its the most likely to come with a somewhat relaible report,0
a handful of unproven destroyers with no means to keep them forward deployed china doesnt have a blue water navy and wont until they figure out the logistics of resupplying one without long range force projection capabilities those 10 destroyers are more akin to a coast guard either way the us has large numbers of fighters and bombers in the pacific region that are much more advanced than anything china can throw at them air superiority in 2021 is determined by sensors and range which are two things the us leads china by a huge margin those chinese planes would be shot down before they ever got in missile range also why bring up the zumwalt program when it has been cancelled the us has already shifted to their next generation of destroyersopen warfare with the usa would be a disaster for china which is precisely why xi will never let it happen china would be quickly ostracized if they attempted to invade best china and chinas lack of allies would be disastrous in such a scenario,0

he got more of a punishment than when trump mocked the disabled journalist,0
one of the first things that came to mind by default honestlyseems that whenever the us supports one side during a proxy war russia or china or whoever else supports the other and it always leads to more lives lost no id like to think starting a civil in another country is the last option that should be taken even if its probably one of the easier ones,0
sowhat about china mr un,0
they tend not to be one and done though it might have a chance in myanmar since they recently had a democratic regime and the military does not have the support of the populace but i doubt any country will risk trillions tens of thousands of dead soldiers and a multi year war in case it does indeed turn into a drawn out war,0

we dont want america as the world policebut also why isnt america stopping this,0
normally id agree with you however your point of view requires you to completely ignore outside facts witnesses and victims to come to your conclusionwe know for a fact that a genocide is taking place because we have so much proof that there can be no denial we have people who have been there and seen what is happening we have people who have been involved with what is happening we have people who have reported with video evidence on what is happeningthis is why any attempt to disprove what is going on by chinas government will bet met with extreme scepticism because its the equivalent of a un representative pulling their pants down and shitting on a desk during session then trying to gaslight everyone around into thinking it never happened,0

arent you kinda contradicting yourself here how will the people of myanmar gear up at this point theyd need medical aid from the us when myanmar is now facing a human rights problem you have to remove the issue of thinking helping is bad we never went to those countries to help their problems cause we made the wrong choice we always shouldve reacting and having other countries do the same would put pressure on never letting the country start an issue 100 we should condemn and stop whats going on in china but its gone on for too long that its become difficult other countries see no wrong now because theyve gotten away with doing bad things and now want no problems with intervening with another country doing the same we never should pick and choose but be strong and react whenever their is an issue as big as these,0

no as a western consumer of news it is my duty to be aware of how the media i consume works with the security states i live under we understand from the preparations for war in iraq or indeed any other overseas intervention the us and its nato allies feel like making that the public have been subjected to false reporting saddam gaddafi noriega allende etc etc we see a torrent of reporting about a strong man terrorising his people later we discover the lies but the military intervention is behind us at that pointim not personally invested in my country or the constellation of countries i was born into so i am not swayed by stories that china is contesting our national interest in the pacific it mostly looks to me like we have no business being over there,0

the majority of expert opinions that i have read have expected covid to be endemic because of how carelessly people are allowing it to spread and mutate correct me if im wrong or out of line but it looks like youre attributing their acceptance of that expectation to some nefarious capitalist plot to make even more money i dont think that to be the case what i read is an acceptance of mainstream scientific predictions and figuring out how to profit off of iti agree that we all should be wary of pfizer and any of these companies as the pharmaceutical industry does have a history of malpractice but this doesnt seem to be anything out of the ordinary to me,0

in a modern world where everyone is trading with everyone else the very concept of warfare is really stupid if china and the us were to go to war china would lose almost all of its international trade and the us would lose almost all of its inexpensive consumer goods including electronicsand to what end would they attempt to conquer each other would china become the next 50 or more us states would america become a giant chinese sweatshop neither actually wants that would they wipe each other out like ancient barbarian hordes what does that actually accomplish when continued trade is more practicalyet everyone keeps saber rattling as though open conflict is something anyone would actually consider doing its so dumb,0

thats true but no one seemed to have a fucking clue how destructive that war would be so many high level people still assumed that it would be fought with canons and marching formations like previous european wars ww1 had so much new tech in it that it changed everything from artillery to machine guns planes and tanks i dont think anyone is under the illusion that it wouldnt cost millions and millions of lives of people getting obliterated by a modern military like the us or china it would be easily the bloodiest conflict the world has ever seen by far,0

question for anyone who might knowin practical terms what is this likely to mean in terms of usturkey relations i dont mean the usual rhetorical stuff i mean trade military concerns that sort of thing,0
finally overdue,0
lets goooooo,0

who cares what the turkish government thinks,0

gt president joe biden is poised to formally recognize the armenian genocide on saturday the new york times reported per officials familiar with deliberations on the matter in a historic move that could further roil usturkey relations gt biden would be the first sitting us president to officially recognize the killing of 15 million armenians by the ottoman empire during world war i as genocide gt turkey has urged biden against recognizing the killings as genocide at a time when the dynamic between washington and ankara is already historically contentious speaking on the matter during an interview with the turkish broadcaster haberturk on tuesday turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said statements that have no legal binding will have no benefit but they will harm ties,0
there was a reboot of das boot das reboot,0
my greatgrandma fled from smyrna during the great fire she passed away in 2019 im sure that some survivors even a very small percentage are still alive right nowits sad that most turkish people vehemently deny it its even more sad when they make jokes about it we taught greeks how to swim and stuff like thatim not expecting anything to change in the future but seeing people learning more about these atrocities makes me kinda happy,0
one advantage of electing a man whos too old to give a fuck,0
exactly worsen ties even more lol this turkish asshole of a dictator has been doing whatever the fuck he wants since forever dont get him angry or he might just keep on doing it ok,0
protesting in russia seems genuinely risky these people are brave,0
the fact that the president of chad died like 3 days ago while visiting the front lines just highlights what youre saying,0

i feel like russias aggressions recently are finally biting them in the ass its like that drunk aggro dude at all of your parties who you cant stand for the first time everyone together is telling him he aint welcome,0
til that the turkish government is really just the ottoman empire redux electric boogaloo,0
pretty mindblowing that this dude was a comedian who got elected because he played the president on tv and now hes increasingly involved in global events and talking about leading his country through a war to the last man,0
he doesnt care same as bolsonaro in brazil i can only imagine its because it disproportionately affects poor people,0
especially after obama campaigned on it and then reneged to avoid pissing off turkey,0
wth is modi doing like does he not see the situation in india,0
my flatmates are indian they just had their baby 3 days ago the day they got back from the hospital they got a call that his father his in india with covid and is seriously illnow they are deciding if they pack up and head back there with a new baby and a mother that had a problematic birth if they go there they most certainly wont be able to get back to new zealand until most likely next year due to our covid restrictions our country is community covid free so they will be leaving a safe place to go somewhere that is a death zone i am telling them not to go especially with a brandnew baby and how she is at the moment but it is not my father who is dying,0
i await jimmy carters second term beginning in 2024,0
ive talked to a few japanese exchange students and theyve all said they deserved the nukes they are forced to go to the museums and learn about what they did but just not all of it,0
they claim its was just a war they dont deny killing the armenians but claim the armenians fought back which is just ridiculous because the armenians were vastly outnumbered,0
turkey needs to face historical reality as do we all,0
until it doesnt we are all going to be fucked when another variant pops up that our vaccines cant handle also fuck those leaders that dont care about all citizens,0
it is about time that our government actually did something to make us proud we have been embarrassed by them for such a long time,0
any indian bros who can tell me what exactly the amaranth pilgrimage is about,0
sleep with ease young lad because ww3 isnt remotely possible as long as russian elites keeps all their stolen goods and their families in western countries even more some of putin closest allies have western citizenship they are posing like brutes but in reality theyre scared shitless themselves losing their cosy lifestyle is their worst nightmare,0
actually its the gops wet dream,0
fuck putin,0
well what you say pretty much applies essentially to all countries in the world not just the uk but yes,0
this has always been the moment i think about when people would argue that they liked trump because he didnt take shit from peoplea foreign nations security forces literally attacked us citizens on us soil in broad daylight on camera and he was too cowardly to do anything,0
so whats the turkish justification for not recognizing the event,0
yeah from what i understand most japanese people accept it but the government doesnt really acknowledge it and tries to avoid responsibility,0
i hope it works saying this as someone who lives in russia,0
russian here i participated in protests in moscow today everything was unexpectedly peaceful police didnt beat people and almost didnt detain but for some reason police was very brutal in st petersburg i have no idea why such difference between two major cities in january it was equally rough everywhere,0
and now his son is attempting a coup turns out losing your top elected representative is a big deal,0
watched he ordered it,0
please tell them if the father is in the hospital then most likely the son and grandson are susceptible to covid its a really bad idea going there while families died in us in some cases and right now india is on the brink of oxygen shortage which makes the situation a lot worsea good father would not want to endanger their son and their grandchild as horrible as the situation is its best for them to stay put,0
doesnt this mean the usual make more tweets,0
protest in russia jailsing russian anthem wrong believe it or not jailforget to salute daddy putin straight to jail,0
its also being massively underreported by a factor of 10 by the most conservative estimates both contraction and deaths crematoriums and graveyards are overwhelmed people are lining on the roads with corpses in my city theres no oxygen no medication no beds no ventilators in my city the state capital of perhaps the most populous administrative unit read state in the world uttar pradesh we have a population of over 220 million and the administration is hiding cremation ghats with tin and steel sheets to hide the actual scene and underreporting cases and deaths they did this to us they had over a year to prepare but they did their rallies and religious events now my country is on fire i lost a friend yesterday aged 29 with no preexisting conditions because his oxygen levels dipped and hospitals wouldnt admit him ive lost family members acquaintances mentors and friends and theyve said there wont be a lockdown they want us to die they just dont care some other nonsensical farce will be fabricated and our soldout media will start their theatre again and cozen and fool the nation once again because were all so scared our government has forsaken us entirely we dont know what to do my country is burning,0
ah yes the same way the deep political cultural and filial ties of 19th century europe prevented world wars,0
russia is super boned there is zero chance this ends well for the country as a whole the sooner they get rid of that megalomaniac putin the betterbut it sounds like that wont be happening,0
and you know all the ancient armenian churches unrelatedly scattered all over modern day eastern turkey where nearly no armenians remain,0
i dont understand why modernday turkey and the turks make the wartime behavior of the ottoman empire their identity they could choose not toi grew up in germany in the 90s and neither us kids nor the politicians would have felt like making the past behavior our identity responsibility yes but not identity as my history teacher said then we can choose to be the good guys you know,0
can some one give a tldr what does this mean is it a win for putin or navalny,0
indian here you guys seriously need to know just how disastrous the management of the pandemic here has been in the last 34 months let alone media from outside even their indian counterparts wont cover this and i do not know why while we were suffering from lack of healthcare our prime minister narendra modi was busy conducting mass rallies for a state election yes rallies having people in numbers of hundreds of thousands with no covid appropriate behaviour i could go on and on the world needs to know we logged over 340k cases yesterday with 2800 deaths the situation is very grim here learn from us and stay safe people,0
censorship is real these companies are turning their backs on the very fabric that made them successful by connecting people,0
we already have some nuclear bombs that are great at getting rid of covid unfortunately they get rid of people and infrastructure at the same time,0
i dont think the people that are arrested will be treated as good as alexi navalny either and hes been treated like shit,0
the difference is that the uk has now admitted it,0

maybe the ottoman empire during the later period but you should remember its a 700 year old empire turkish nationalism wasnt a thing for the majority of their reign it was a multiethnic empire which wasnt necessarily dominated by turks the entire time for example the jannisaries who were slaves taken mostly from southeast europe and raised in the capital to be the elite military and political force enjoyed a great deal of power despite technically being slaves they overthrew sultans numerous times and one of the major complaints during the rise of turkish nationalism was the exclusion of turks into the jannissary corp for a few hundred years they were the most powerful political force in the empire and they were not turkish turkish nationalism and the nationalist movements in ottoman occupied territories occurred during the nationalist movements in europe this generally occurred during the 18th20th century i would say its more of a turkish idealistic view of the ottoman empire redux electric boogaloo,0

seriously some of the things i witnessed in india were incredibly messed up the worst and mind you this is just what i personally witnessed from my fairly sheltered and privileged position was a young woman who had been thrown out for giving birth to a girl she was living with her baby in a single concrete room with no windows lights or running water the baby didnt even have cloth diapers or clothes they definitely didnt have enough food her family wouldnt take her inguaranteed this will happen more when families want male children grandchildren but face fanatical penalties for having more babiesany population control policies in india would have to be very carefully designed to prevent mass increase in female infanticide and domestic abuse,0
boys are also already favored in india so i absolutely think the same problem would happen,0

gt the papers seen by the guardian seem to represent a serious and highly unusual leak from within the kremlinso unusually in fact that we should be very skeptical and do much more investigation i see three possibilities in order of likelihood1 this was intentionally released because trump is no longer valuable to russia aside from the us still being in nato they got what they wanted and now have literally hundreds of minitrumps in various positions of power throughout us and even european politics2 this was intentionally released because russia wants it to look like they have the power to pull this off liberals will say see and conservatives will say fake news no ones minds will be changed and polarization in the us will increase3 it was a leak,0

can anyone explain how the us and british forces have spent 20 years in the country training a new afghan army only for the taliban to walk into every major city within a couple of weeks with no resistance what was the entire point,0
did our intelligence community seriously think the afghan army was going to put up a fight,0

traced this back the info comes from the russian embassy in afghanistan repeated by an afghan diplomat in tajikistan who hates ghani then tweeted by a bbc reporter finally repeated by yahoo op when asked for evidence the russian spokesman said well we are here,0
its also the region that broke the soviets they launched 9 different major offensives into the valley the 5th and 6th offensives finally took the lower valley at the cost of 3000 soviet casualties but they never really secured it and had to keep sending in offensives to retake it even after that,0
let me guess tomorrow it would be kabul,0
they managed to take over the city before i finished my laundry,0
at least bush and cheney are still around to see the taliban capture kabul on the 20th anniversary of 911,0

us predictions counted on afghan troops fighting back to buy just enough time for us to leave turns out the army didnt want to die just just to buy the us time,0
having a top official there will also somehow deter the talibans from going wild in kabul anything happens to him will probably ensure a swift retaliation from uk he is leveraging on this to help as many as possible,0
they are going back to original recipe taliban,0
a war that the us started an led for almost 20 years cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars the us pulls out and 2 months later the taliban have taken back control of pretty much the entire country what a sad joke,0

ie were excellent judges of morality i say we need to sexually assault recruits to make sure theyre not immoral,0
dont forget the part where the taliban is capturing humvees and western armaments so after 20 years we succeeded in overturning the stagnant taliban leadership making room for more radical younger leadership and providing them westernbuilt munitions instead of sovietbloc munitions i guess well see what the chinese do with the place,0
i mean i imagine they also thought the afghan army would fight back just for the sake of preventing the taliban from taking control of their country turns out they didnt want to die for that either,0

there is no collective identity there is only the disparity between urban and rural nationbuilding is hard work and doing it within predetermined lines which have never taken the people they surround into consideration turns an uphill battle into a cliffscaling struggle others can give a fledgling nation all the labels they want but for aspiring states like kabul if you want to unite the surrounding area which already has various concentrated power bases then youre starting with a feudal society,0
why are they planning on hunting for truffles,0
im an afghan woman living in europe my parents and sibling are stuck in kabul we tried to get the visas to closest neighboring countries like india or pakistan as traveling by road is impossible all borders are controlled by taliban prices for visas and tickets have sky rocketed i tried to send money to get flight tickets but banks and western union offices are all closed and even worse out of cash my parents couldnt even get their saving from their bank accounts all my friends and their families and my relatives are stuck i get panic attack every other moment and stopped reading and following news to calm down all i can hope for them is to be safe its unbelievable how fast the situation deteriorated,0
american intelligence estimates that it will be a month of siege on kabul before any taliban negotiations are done aaaaaand its gone,0
youre lucky we dont immediately stone you,0
the americans and others were there for 20 years fighting the taliban how can it be that after the withdrawal of the troops they are still so strong that they can completely conquer the country in a few weeks,0
somebody has to help the taliban sort all the remaining paper at the us embassy,0

here are two very good articles you should read first article and second article the truth is this probably wouldnt ever go any other way back by the end of bushs presidency the military already realized afghanistan was not gon na stand on its own which is why as soon as obama got elected they pushed him to do the troop surge so they could redouble efforts to fight the taliban that didnt really do much in the end and we were in the same place we were before its been an open secret in the military for 20 years that this would happen people in this thread keep coming back to military industrial complex and how we didnt want to help we just wanted us corporations to profit and that probably isnt wrong to a degree but it severely discounts the reality the reality is that you cant just will a nation into existence even with 20 years you can not people in this thread argue if we had just spent more money or focused better on different things but thats just blind naivety,0

i guess the biggest problem is how canada deals with water water is handled at the municipal level where property taxes mainly fund the water and sewage with the odd grant from the province or federal i grew up near curve lake peterborough and still have a cottage just a tad north of it what i dont get is why not spend the 1020k a well and a make some wells thats what the vast majority of non reserve folks do around that area you can also put in water filtration systems and pull from the lake but there a bit more work to maintain vs a well,0

this is what the rejected draft statement saidgt the members of the security council gt expressed grave concern regarding the crisis related to gaza and the loss of civilian lives and casualties and called for deescalation of the situation cessation of violence and respect for international humanitarian law including the protection of civilians especially childrengt emphasized that civilian and humanitarian facilities including those of the un must be respected and protected called on all parties to act consistently with this principle and stressed the need for immediate provision of humanitarian assistance to the palestinian civilian population in gazagt welcomed all efforts to deescalate and to reach a ceasefire agreement including from regional states and the middle east quartet and urged all actors to support these effortsit was drafted by norway china and tunisia,0

and justifiably so,0
the security council is a musical chairs kind of place,0
the amount of negativity around this is astounding conservation is and has always been a doubleedged blade often coming from people with the means but also not entirely selfless intentions thats ok thats how it has always been but so many here have seen a questionable netflix doc and say well this will do nothing what about xyorz my guess is as with most formed opinions on the internet these days many of you have never been to galapagos and have seen firsthand the incredibly complex systems at play small donations help but are also like throwing solocups of water on a fire large private donations like this genuinely matter the effects matter the media attention matters the personal reasons of leo dont matterincidentally in my time working in galapagos in the early 2000s i know leo visited the islands out of personal interest in conservation he helped aid efforts back then too so this fits within his character sometimes people have personal interests even the very famouswill this fix the world or even all the perils facing galapagos of course not but the islands have many incredible success stories that have global impact its not all just about horny tortoises,0
yeah this is diplomacy as usual which we kind of expected to go back to but this makes me livid too i get theres complexities but getting thanks for this is gross,0

his net worth seems kinda low compared to how famous he is or maybe my view is just skewed but yeah seems like a great move from the guy imo,0
i hope this stays in the media until hes actually released radiolab did a series about a detainee who was approved for release at the end of obamas administration and is still being held for unexplained reasons the implication is that no politician wants to deal with the publicity that comes with releasing someone from gitmo regardless of innocence nor the risk of the fallout if that person is ever identified as later acting against the us too many of our politicians are cowards,0
paracha is not a continuing threat to the usbecause hes our prisoner indefinitely,0
iran is literally funding and advising hamas since their rocket attacks give them fantastic information about the capabilities of israeli defence systems they love thishes saying what people want to hear but id hope people are able to see through this,0

irans foreign minister we prefer to kill our children with imprecision,0
the us has a long history of blocking any criticism of israel even vetoing any attempt by the un to condemn their behavior unfortunately this is par for the course for several previous administrations not just biden,0
she doesnt have to go back if she doesnt feel safeif she does shes braver than she is right now if not no one should blame her,0
the way all sides of the political spectrum in america except for alexandria ocasiocortez bend over backwards for israel is sort of uncanny valley like you can just see that sometihng is wrong feels so unnatural and weird especially when american politicians cant even agree across the aisle on something as simple as coronavirusampx200bthe influence israel has over american domestic politics is quite sinister,0
googled networths are mostly made up bullshit anyways always either way high or too low,0
its not genocide if israel does it,0
if you give them billions in aid every year and then sell them arms arent you basically paying them to arm themselves,0
netanyahu is a war criminal akin to putin who will do whatever it takes to stay in power as dictator for life while continuing advances as a colonist murdering innocent civilians heres just a little of what israel has been doing in terms of war crimes and human rights violations using palestinians as human shields targeting the mediamedia sitesjournalist human rights violations attacking a holy site on a holy day collective punishment illegally conquering land,0
if this is antiisrael i think that speaks volumes about what israel is,0
biden is infamous for shit like this it was then vice president joe biden who called the embassies of every country and threatening consequences if they allow asylum to edward snowden,0
quits,0
i wish this headline were fake but it turns out it israel,0
for her sake i hope she doesnt go back,0
i mean its not just biden this is simply your yearly reminder that us foreign policy isnt about goodness and harmony its about us interests overseas,0
tax the digital monopolies now this should be a winwin if biden is even a little serious about tackling inequality and budget deficits,0
the short answer is you cant the magic of recycling is a big propaganda piece told to us mainly by plastic manufacturers to make us not feel bad about using so much plastic less than 10 of plastics in use actually get recycled the rest ends up mostly in landfills some of it goes into the ocean,0
because they block everything that goes through the un that resembles anything close to a criticism of the israeli governments actionsyou thought biden would be different it was he and obama who gave them that 38billion a year deal,0
we had no intention of killing civiliansidf twitter account,0
that has always been my takeaway if you didnt detain a terrorist you just fucking made one with this horseshit travesty of justice,0
plastic is a petroleum product made by the people who refine petroleum no shit,0

i feel like if an american is capable of reading a news article they should know that meter is pretty close to a yard in length so there should be no problem with just saying 40 meters because to be honest i dont really have a good frame of reference for how far 131 feet is anyways,0

kind of like biden asking israel to stop the violence while selling them 735m in weapons and also singlehandedly blocking a un resolution condemning israel for the violence in the same day,0
honestly this misses the pointthey leveled an entire building that housed offices used by hundreds of civilians yes including several news agencies thats an insanely disproportionate responseits like a citys police department burning down an entire apartment block because a murderer was allegedly inside no sane society would accept that level of force it wouldnt even be up for debate anywhere else in the world,0
this and things like this is 100 why the democrat party did everything they could to ensure it was biden and not bernie who became their candidate biden is business as usual,0
this is what shahid jameel said 2 weeks agogt policy has to be based on evidence and not the other way around he told reuters i am worried that science was not taken into account to drive policy but i know where my jurisdiction stops as scientists we provide the evidence policymaking is the job of the governmenthe also wrote an article in the new york times 3 days ago tldr he talks about inaccurate data due to low testing scientists not being given access to all of the data slow vaccination and issues with indias vaccine procurement strategy the monthlong kumbh religious festival attended by 91 million devotees lack of evidencebased policymakingregarding the last point most of the critical decisions related to the pandemic such as lockdowns vaccine procurement etc are made directly by prime minister modis office without really consulting epidemiologists and other experts in fact even the union cabinet supreme decisionmaking body in india has been sidelined,0
so whats the world going to do about itnothing as usual,0
right this doesnt put blame on anyone all it really says is stop killing civilians but i guess thats too much to ask for,0

banning a boycott is actually unconstitutional it wouldnt survive a supreme court challenge,0
it isnt a big victory but id bet the dispatch at the ilwu hall was rightfully pissed its not easy to unexpectedly send longshoremen to another ship youve already assigned jobs and anyone who didnt get one went home already you can try to call them in but they already started drinking and good luck getting a full crew without pulling from your other shipsyeah its only a delay and probably wont save any palestinians but i still admire what they did theyre gon na catch a lot of shit for that and likely miss a few ships worth of worksource once a longshoreman always a longshoreman,0

not particularly shocking i worked 90 hours last week and all i could think about afterwards was how absolutely terrible i felt and how poor an impact it is likely having on my overall health absolutely depressing,0
but of course war is in his best interest anything to distract the people of israel from holding him accountable for his crimes,0
i mean its one way to leave your mark on history thats more than most could ever hope for,0
of course biden will support israel despite war crimes in 1986 joe biden said if israel didnt exist the us would have to invent one to protect us interests,0
the us supports israels murderous pogrom against palestine with money and weapons the us does this in spite of its own law against it america is a fascist paradise,0
culture is a huge part of it in vancouver any city in the region with a heavy indian population is considered a hot spot our local indian community fought against the initial restrictions for months tried to hold festivals keep community halls open and flouted mask regulations eventually that came back to roost due to large family groups living in single houses,0

thats by design 21st century conflicts are truly full spectrum states no longer control the narrative around events and debates that once were limited to discussing the facts as presented by a handful of newspapers at dinner parties now play out across twitter reddit and facebook with almost no cohesive set of information people are working off of its why the idf and many other countries for that matter invest so much capability into manufacturing the debate in a positive direction while simultaneously looking to degrade the ability for an opposing side to get their own narrative acrossthis will only become worse in the coming decades,0
i reject any call to stop my reelection campaign and my attempts to distract from my corruption ill keep murdering people if i want to thank you very much and if that includes getting my own people killed then so fucking be it,0

if it looks like a facist swims like a facist and quacks like a facist then it probably is a benjamin netanyahu,0
because the us says its notjust like what china is doing to the uighurs isnt genocide because they say its notjust like whats happening in yemen isnt a human rights violation because the ussaudi arabia say its notpick any poor country and youll find someone who has an incentive to commit human rights violation and youll probably find another external leader who is defending and economicallypolitically benefiting by convincing others to look the other wayid say weve lost our way as societybut this has literally been the way foreveri think because in our recent history weve had some powerful progressive movements civil rights suffrage globalization that we forget how suppressive the world and people in power naturally are,0
well they wouldnt want to kill their business of supplying the israelis with the means to bomb the shit out of them,0

its geopolitics not geohonesty,0
classic super vilain move,0
netanyahu the dictator for life really is trying his best to cement a legacy akin to saddam hussein isnt he disgusting he needs to be voted out and imprisoned for his war crimes and corruption charges,0

its more than that really israel has made it clear since oslo through its settlement and forced relocation program its keeping jerusalem its keeping the west bank and it doesnt want to keep and of the people living there theres only one way that theyre getting the land without the people and whatever diplomatic overtures may have been made there is never going to be a two state solutionhamas as likud have both just been preparing for that eventuality its no longer possible with the state of settlements having reached major metropolitan levels throughout occupied palestine for those areas to ever really be returned theres not going to be a palestinian state there isnt now and things are getting farther from it every daywhat you have right now is an apartheid state where the knesset rules the whole of the country and carefully isolates and manages the movements of a nonvoting ethnic underclass hamas rocket attacks were like every attempt to use terrorism to confront apartheid little more than an excuse for the overclass to crack down israels response is little more than the formalization of the status quo this is no longer a war between nations but a conflict within one in the end its too late and too far gone for a two state solution without massive relocations and upheaval that would themselves constitute genocide people are going to have to choose between a shared state without an ethnic or religious identity or genocide it shouldnt surprise people that conservative voices on both sides call for the latter nor should it be forgiven but its not a grift its just the inevitable end result of three decades of settlement and annexation,0

complementing your thoughts it is important to understand that couples do differ if you see other couples having a division of labor that is not similar to yours it does not automatically mean that someone is being oppressed,1
i dont think the title is very accurate just look at any normal company workers dont split all the different jobs equally they specialize but ideally all do the same amount of laborthe problem with division of labor in many households is that women complain that men dont do as much labor as women do i cant imagine many women preferring that their husband sit on his ass on the couch most of the time while she cooks and cleans and tends to the children and him mowing the lawn once a week is enough for his contributionwhat theyre describing here is specialization of labor which is always preferable to people doing jobs they arent wellsuited for as long as the overall amount of labor is roughly equivalent its the preferred situation unequal labor is when some people are contributing far more than others,1

one thing worth pointing out is that they provided a much better breakdown of effectiveness not only looking at the disease itself but also looking at infectionfor those who are not aware covid19 is the disease sarscov2 is the virus you can have the virus without the disease in earlier trials they had only reported covid19 disease incidence here they also reported sarscov2 infectionsthis is the graph where the data isso by the perprotocol analysis using the secondary case definition they reported 933 effectiveness of the vaccine 14 days after the second dose 479999 but when looking at sarscov2 infection the effectiveness is just 557 168764this means the vaccine is leaky it protects against the disease without approaching 100 effectiveness against infection and the cdc found vaccinated people infected with the delta variant have similar viral load than infected unvaccinated people which they concluded was a signal both were equally contagiousthis is basically a confirmation of observations from israel the uk and iceland from a vaccinemakers rctalso something interesting from the table is that 45 out of 65 sarscov2 infections in the placebo group were asymptomatic that is very interesting data as well that suggests two thirds of all sarscov2 infections among 1217 yearolds are completely asymptomatic even without the vaccine,1

criminologist here i studied this a bit a while ago a big reason why is psychological differences in how man and women experience depression for whatever reason men tend to experience suicidal tendencies and depression as a long steady slow decline whereas women tend to get spikes of suicidal thoughts usually as a reaction to a reallife negative event how does this translate into suicide men tend to think long and hard about it and plan their suicides they will go off and away and commit suicide making sure they do it in a place where nobody sees them and making sure they do it successfully women tend to attempt suicide at a much higher rate actually they are just less successful in acute periods of suicidal thoughts meaning they dont plan it and they often do it in the home where others find them meaning they survive people like to bring up methods in that men use guns more but men have higher death rates for every other type of suicide as well there is a theory i read that women evolutionarily tended to commit suicide when they were in danger whereas men tended to commit suicide when they were ashamed or dishonored this would play a big role in how suicidal thoughts affect us but its obviously a very loose theory,1

lots of previous research suggests that maternal fevers during the first and second trimester are strongly associated with autism so its not super surprising that women who have taken fever reducing medication while pregnant would be more likely to have autistic kidswhats not at all clear is where the causal link would be is it the tylenol itself or is it the fever something else to do with the immune system activating my guess is that its probably not the tylenol causing the effect seen here but rather it is just an association but its only a guess,1

typical neuron activity is mediated by sodium and allow cells to perform logical and and or operations they discovered that in a sample taken from an epilepsy patient a section removed to treat the epilepsy the neurons could also be mediated by calcium which allows the neurons to perform a logical xor operation they confirmed this activity in tumorous sections of brain that had been removed during surgery this has not observed this behavior in mice beforeso it looks like we need to find out if this mechanism is in all humans or only epileptic and cancer patients we also need to find out if its all neurons or only ones from certain areas of the brain that can do this then we have to start studying a bunch of other primates and mammals to find out if its just humans that have this signaling pathwayit would be very interesting to find out that only humans have this mechanism though i sincerely doubt that is the case because it could give some strong clues to why humans developed higher intelligence i look forward to seeing the work of other groups to confirm this and to expand the research to help us better understand the extent of this previously unobserved mechanism,1

this is the part i found interestinggt interestingly when describing things their partners could do to show their sexual desire many men described actions that were romantic rather than sexual for example 18 of the men wanted more romance from their partners 16 wanted more nonsexual touch and 19 insinuated they wanted more flirtingteasing from their partnersi think men in general are conditioned to not ask for romance but the truth is that it definitely is important to men when my wife buys me flowers or is physically affectionate it makes a huge difference in terms of my mood and how i feeladditionally i think physical affection and initiating sex is also a significant part of this gt when the men were asked what their partners were currently doing to make them feel desired 41 described ways their partners expressed their attraction verbally 34 mentioned their partners initiating physical touch 28 mentioned their partners initiating physical activity and 19 described their partners being enthusiasticexcited during sexwhen my wife or other partners in the past have desired me and made the moves it really made me that much more invested in the relationship what i found surprising was that 88 of men feel like that their partners could be doing better that says a lot im in a very happy relationship but when i examine how i feel ill admit there are definitely things my wife could do thatll make a significant difference,1

in the us theres a strong push for people to work hard for a better life for themselves to some extent this is a good philosophy people should work hard for what they want but unfortunately all too often this philosophy is turned around backwards and used to say that people who dont have a good life clearly just didnt work hard enough this is then expanded and generalized to say that all poor people must just be lazy selfobsessed druggies i think thats where the notion that poor people wont spend free money correctly comes from theyre poor because theyre lazy and selfcentered and since theyre lazy and selfcentered theyll clearly just waste that money on themselvesthe numbers dont back that up but that view point has been ingrained into many people from such a young age that its hard to break,1

when you get vaccinated antibodies appear in your blood after about six months there are a lot fewer antibodies in your blood not zero but a lot less this means youre more likely to get infected if you come in contact with covid19 compared to only one to three months post vaccinationhowever the small amount of antibodies in your blood will still detect the presence of the virus and report it to your memory b cells which will quickly respond and pump out a ton of antibodies to fight the virus this is why even six months later vaccinated individuals are highly unlikely to get seriously ill when infectedthis is kind of standard behavior for vaccines when you got a polio shot your body made a ton of polio antibodies then they mostly go away but not entirely you dont maintain activeinfection levels of antibody for every vaccine youve ever gotten for your entire life as a healthy covid vaccinestudying immunologist this news is not frightening this is normal the shot works the only problem is the unvaccinated population acting as a covid reservoir,1

im a little confused about what the relationship between sexual function and sensitivity is obviously a man can have sex without a foreskin so he still sexually functions on a basic level but wouldnt that sensitivity be a function of the penis if a guy got circumcised and his usual way of masturbating or sex doesnt get him off any more would that lower his functionality or is it strictly an onoff thing,1

interestingly the authors do note on page 4 thatgtalthough our methodology is generally applicable to many online platforms we apply it here to reddit which has maintained a minimalist approach to personalized algorithmic recommendation throughout its history by and large when users discover and join communities they do so through their own exploration the content of what they see is not algorithmically adjusted based on their previous behaviour since the user experience on reddit is relatively untouched by algorithmic personalization the patterns of community memberships we observe are more likely the result of user choices and thus reflective of the social organization induced by natural online behaviourwhich means that reddit users may be less vulnerable to individual polarization than say facebook or twitter since users here actively have to select the communities they participate in rather than have content algorithmically produced for them,1

its a quixotic endeavor to form groups to do good but humanity relies on such people to counterbalance however in a minimum way all the evil made by others of course there are always egos frictions between the aims of the members those people are also humans but many many times they succeed in making the group strong and cohesive based on personal ethics,1
youre talking about rebalancing the internalized rewards of the behavior in individuals via their environment which doesnt sound cheesy to me id add that the internalized consequences of bullying can be reinforced as well by teaching kids to be selfaware about their own social drives and the shortcuts theyll be tempted to take before they reach an age where they may pick up the behavior once bullying becomes habit theyre already building rationalizations to defend those behaviors not seeking an alternative that values mutual respect or love and kindness,1

i find this curious i graduated in ireland 2004 and my memory of attending an all boys secondary school was of a place of sad conformity discipline and an all pervasive repressive atmosphere while there were few bullies in the physical sense there was a lot of social bullying almost a climate of fear where everyone was happy for someone else to be the targeti had read that kids these days and school culture generally had changed to something far more supportive and open minded i had read that zoomers generally were much more empathetic and forgivingdo you think you just got unlucky with the school you are at or do you think its part of a wider trend where abouts are you,1

by 3rd grade i understood that social life was almost entirely driven by the struggle to invent elevate and climb the social hierarchy being poor and nonreligious i was doomed and by 5th grade was pretty happily accepting and disengaged by 7th and 8th grade i realized that social life after that could not be understood on the basis of invented hierarchies alone and that sex was the crucial dimension to be added to understanding others these two realizations as simple as they are are far more reliable guides in navigating public social relationshipspoliticians employers everyone subtleties are distractions neuroses are window dressing to these two core motivations as a person who has remained utterly confused by people for my entire life these two motivations have at least been the most successful in deconstructing understanding predicting and interacting with others its like feeding gerbils at times especially as i get older the illusions of complexity grow thinner with time compared to food status and sex realizing the status part was critical early on ignoring it meant being bullied and it gave me a clear path to ending it the way it started so that i could remain disengaged the bullys were left with in order a broken femur a ruptured testicle and a broken ulna over three years at three different schools logging towns rough crowds,1

theres a difference between being assertive and being a bullyyou can be assertive and focus on what you want without having to marginalize or outright attack others in the entertainment world its far easier to cut down someone else than it is to build a name for yourself its why the quickest rises to fame are people who attack others you have comedians whose entire livelihood is based on just making fun of peoples physical appearance or worse just making racial stereotype jokes,1
oh boy cant wait for companies to start saying we want lucid dreamers in case we need you to pull a shift at night or better yet we want kids to learn to lucid dream since you learn best with good sleep were going to teach them in good sleep remember kids your homework is due at 3am tonight no matter what,1
gt i seriously dont get why i went from being everyones friend to everyones target in a matter of a week because of what some dicks decided to start sayingwell its exactly as whats being talked about here making fun of you has become the way for people to maintain their position within the high school social hierarchy and not following the trend could prove to be detrimental to their position no rhyme or reason to it and to be honest i cant believe gay is still an insult in 2021 even in high schoolthe good news is that high school will be the end of it or at least it was in my case if youre staying in the same town afterwards the lack of the high school social structure disincentivizes most people from bullying as they no longer need to save face if youre planning on going somewhere else well then all those people will be in your rear view mirror anyhow,1

bullying ruined a fair bit of my childhood and i live with the mental consequences to this very dayi had adopted a very stupid mantra of just dont pay attention to them which of course resulted in me becoming an easy targetthis is why ill never ever go to any kind of school reunion as i would probably murder someone in attendancealso there was the fact that if i ever fought back i would get in trouble while my bully would then act as the victim and subsequently supported by their clique while i was left to fend for myselfif i ever have a kid i will make damn sure that i teach them the proper way to deal with bulliesdont stop til you see blood ill deal with the teacher afterwards,1

wow i always felt like my experience was more akin to teasing because it was a friend of mine it went on for years and it was super fucked up the fact that my trust and desire to fit in was exploited manipulated to bully me for years killed my self esteem and emotional well being more so than if it would have been a stranger or acquaintancemy friend was doing this kind of stuff to climb the social ladder and it worked it happened almost exclusively when in a group of people whereas he was nice when it was just me and him its kind of weird because he grew out of it and we grew to be much better friends as adults still someone i talk to fairly regularly i dont condone what he did but i have a difficult time holding it against him and i dont think he is a bad person by any means,1
dont you enjoy it when a scientific study statistically validates something youve know for literally years,1
yeah you kind of opened yourself up for that one did the bullies arrange formal duels with you and wait for your consent to fight or did they just attack you,1
oof the savagerythat being said america really doesnt stand up against many places outside of europe as well,1
yeah i dont think its less complex or dangerous in boys where weve set up a situation where you can be openly mocked but it has been predetermined that it is in good fun so if you are hurt by it you are the one that has broken the social contract and your group status is lowered,1

makes sense before i transferred to a better school with much better friends in middle school my old friends at my old school turned into total bullies my socalled friends turned on me because i was going to a different school and made my 7th grade year terrible funny thing is there was a stigma that once you left my old school and started going to the private school my new school you turned into a prep and thought you were too good for the public school crowd funny thing is im not the one who changed they did and they wondered why i didnt want to talk to them after i left,1

bullies tend to have traits like charm they are intentional in their manipulation of the environment and they are often able to help control the classroom environment ie they can get the other kids to behave newer teachers teachers who themselves either consciously or un want to be liked accidentally bond to all of this bullies are almost never sid from toy story they are trickybullying programs dont work because they dont address the social currency and structures of school great you debugged and walked away now you have to navigate the difficulties of being unprotected unallied and very possibly explicitly ostracized plus you feel weak conscious pairing of students in classrooms explicit activities to devalue popularity and spread the idea of strength in a variety of talents could go a long way i cringe when i see a teacher tell kids to find a partneralso and then ill get off my soapbox i wish we better equipped kids with strong responses to bullies my dream is to one day get my phd and write a book called no you shut up a compendium of skills and explicit retorts for every age to help parents and teachers help kids to self advocate and feel empowered to stand up to bullies,1

seems quite promising but its important to be aware that there are a few negatives to this report as with most im sure and at least the researchers involved are quite honest about its shortcomings people tend to have a kneejerk emotional reaction to news like this and this is exactly the kind of reporting that will cause hysterically angry parents to demand a week down the line that their paralyzed child receive an immediate stem cell infusion when its not considered the current standard of care anywhere in the world i certainly wouldnt consider doing it at this stage any adverse event leaves you critically medicolegally exposedfirstly these are all patients with cervical central cord syndrome which does typically have a better prognosis for spontaneous recovery than most spinal cord injuries secondly the patients they included are all relatively young fewer than 10 of them over 60 whereas most patients who sustain spinal cord injuries from sudden hyperextension are in the older cohort and older patients tend to show less recovery than younger ones so the scivoletto population study might not be an accurate comparison thirdly this is not a controlled study simply an observational one compared to previously published population outcomesthe most important finding was the absence of adverse effects in this small study and this definitely paves the way for a formal controlled study and hopefully the eventual inclusion of msc in spinal cord injury management protocols from what i can see it seems relatively straightforward and probably quite affordable bone marrow harvest extract and culture stem cells infuse intravenously and certainly something that could be done with relative ease in most spinal centres one asia grade makes a giant difference to functional capacity and the likelihood for independence,1

stem cell isnt covered by insurance at least it wasnt in 2017 the atlanta clinic has their own financing the treatment cost was around 8000 we set up a payment planwhen my wife went back for her 30 day checkup she made a joke about wanting to get another treatment she was buzzing with happiness the doctor replied with we have an opening tomorrow morning i responded with one those chevy chase giggles that are meant to be sarcastic well they put her on the books and the finance officer think betty white grabbed my arm and lead me to her office to write up another finance plan just like your grandma was going to make you another plate of biscuits how could i say anything but lets light this candle granny i was paying 500 a month i had a job loss i called betty she asked me how much can i pay she lowered it and thats how its been with that clinic the doctor was one of the best people i have ever met his name is anthony clavo md and he now resides in texas you have to remember when you live in forever pain you visit doctor offices more then you go to the grocery store and you leave every appointment with tears as you make that silent dreadful ride home because theres nothing more we can do for you when you find that doctor its a wave of excitement and its all you talk about,1
gt that they do so more than they would with adultsyou misread that it was the opposite the dogs synchronized less with the children,1

well the fun parent is usually the one who is around less because the primary caregiver is also the primary disciplinarian whereas the other parent mostly just does the fun parts when they see you they like you but they also know its possible youre about to give them a bath so its more cautious you said when he gets home which also lead me to assume that he spends more time away from home than you do if thats the case then his attention may also be more of a rarity than yours and therefore more sought after if youre home all day then hanging with you may feel like less of a treat small children often do that sort of thing too these are just hypothesis though it could be a lot of different factors dogs are extremely social and so are we but youre probably right that its not just a matter of foodit would be interesting if you and your husband switched jobs for a week if he did the feedingtraining andor if you left the house more often while he stayed home its possible that you might be the fun one,1

without having the exact details known here are some thoughts for you1 mimicking the receptor does not mean that its a functional replacement they might have devised something with similar binding epitopes to trick the virusthat said2 the ace2 receptor to my understanding is found on surfaces like the cell lining of the lungs and more i assume that if the mimicry they designed is similar enough to trick the normal receptor ligand ang iang ii then this dilution of ligand reaching true receptor is acceptable the effects may be minimal if any or nonthreatening when used in a short term treatment course as this would suggestnot everything in the body has a dire impact if its manipulated to some degree but the complexity and potential outcomes of even the most safe seeming drugs is why we require extensive clinical testing,1

dogs can also recognize that children are young they know what being a child means just like they know that puppies are different than adult dogs they expect and tolerate different behaviors in human children than they would in a human adult for example and some dogs are more protective of children since they recognize them as more vulnerable so even if they adult isnt necessarily their alpha so to speak they probably recognize that the child is not the one calling the shots around here,1

part of the reason companies have responded so well to digital advertising is that its significantly more trackable individual advertisements are also cheaper and budget can be moved towards the most effective ads quickly look at this study abstract on search advertising as an exampletv ads are expensive and focused on familiarizing people with a product rather than getting them to do a specific behaviour although tracking research is part of those campaigns as well its true that youtube ads are often geared towards brand awareness not clicks but its a lot less expensive for the advertiser and they can more granularly target a specific audience people also hate them so its definitely its own area of studyall this is to say that its definitely not a onetoone comparison you have clicksandsales driven campaigns versus brand campaigns and then on top of that traditional media is on a completely different scale financially,1

sea level rise is neither the largest nor most immediate threat of climate change water happens to have one of the highest and i would argue the most important thermal capacity of all the compounds were likely to come into contact with daily water has about 510 times the heat capacity of most common things and so heating up all the oceans by say 2 degrees average is an enormous amount of energy why is this important the reason we have climate refugees today is not the water level but rather the higher intensity storms that the warmer waters spawn far before people are forced from the shores by rising waters they will be forced from the shores by massive frequent destructive storms that instead of saying destroying 11000 homes will destroy 1100 eventually it will be economically nonviable to live in stormprone zones and those zones will increase in size over time to go far inland away from freshwater causing more migration this is happening now and will be a major factor in the lives of all our children its easy for people to dismiss rising sea levels because it doesnt seem dangerous and happens over decades its far harder for people to dismiss weather disasters that they might have some first or secondhanded experience of or more likely visceral fear of maybe we should have a different metric so instead of sea riseyear we should have expected homes destroyedyear,1

i saw this article earlier and was reading it just now btw the original study is here its open accessanyhow i found the idea of death penalty selfreinforcement interesting they quote a previous article that says once an office assembles a staff that has handled a capital trial it draws upon this capacity to pursue the death penalty in subsequent cases which further augments the offices institutional capacity to pursue the death penalty this selfreinforcing dynamic between capacity and caseload makes it more likely for offices that obtain death sentences to seek the death penalty going forward conversely offices that cease to obtain death penalties or never obtained death penalties in the first place may be less likely to reverse course as institutional capacity for death penalty sentencing erodes or is never developed this path dependency may reflect practices of prosecutors who make the charging decisions whether to seek the death penalty but it may also capture defense lawyering judges jurors and other features of a county that make it more likely to continue to death sentence over time,1
because climate change is so slow people become acclimatized to whatever the next stage is and the next and its un uphill battle to remind them this isnt normal,1
i think this study and the data used need to be contextualizedthe survey was created because in part no largescale national surveys measured gender identity at the time they generally still dont hell the us census also asks no questions about gender identity so we have no true population estimates of trans individuals side note the same is true for sexual identity though they ask about living with a samesex partnera communitybased nonrespondent driven sample of 28000 trans respondents has enormous value to our understanding of the diverse experiences of trans people in the us it can not tell us about loss to followup selfselection bias and other major issues with survey design but neither can the largescale national surveys we use to understand population prevalence in drug use for example nsduh it would be grossly unethical to randomize trans participants to surgery versus treatment as usual so this analysis existing is interesting and important that is not to say its without flaws just that the rush to condemn survey research among an underresearched population is dangerous and antiscience,1
same i used to be optimistic but after seeing how people and governments behave in the face of sudden calamities i have no hope that we can tackle something so slow moving as climate change,1

question based on how the data was collected how valid are the findingsquote in this study we performed a secondary analysis of data from the 2015 us transgender survey the largest existing data set containing comprehensive information on the surgical and mental health experiences of tgd people the survey was conducted across 50 states washington dc us territories and us military bases abroad a total of 27 715 tgd adults took the us transgender survey which was disseminated by communitybased outreach from august 19 2015 to september 21 2015so there are two things that seem to stand out first the survey was disseminated by communitybased outreach which seems to indicate that if a certain person was not in contact with communitybased outreach they would not have been part of the surveysecond it seems reasonable to assume that not everyone who was contacted as part of the survey did actually replyif we take both parts into account how likely is it that the results are affected by this is it reasonable to assume that a people who feel positive about genderaffirming surgeries are more likely to be in contact with communitybased outreach and b that people who feel positive about genderaffirming surgeries were more likely to replyor is it more likely that people who felt negative were more likely to reply if we are talking about business customer satisfaction it is well established that people who had negative experiences are substantially more likely to voice their opinionso based on the data they had how valid are the findungs,1

they compare engagement if someone who averages 2 hours of technology use per day has little difference from someone who averages 12 hours of technology use per day that would suggest a weak associationon the other hand if there were a strong association then we should see more mental health issues in those who spend more time using technology,1

great comment and excellent contextualization i have one quibble which i would be interested to get your view on you say that it would be grossly unethical to randomize trans participants to surgery versus treatment as usual i agree that it would be unethical to assign people to surgery who did not want it or forbid those who do wish to get it from getting it that said trans surgery is expensive cost is often a limiting factor for those who otherwise would want to get it i dont see any reason why offering study participants the opportunity to potentially get free trans surgery would be unethical this would limit the study of effects to an inframarginal population namely trans individuals who want to get surgery but seems like it would be a fairly ethical and rigorous method to understand the causal impact of surgery on mental health for a highly policyrelevant subpopulation,1

the more co2 in the atmosphere the more molecules that can absorb and emit infrared radiation heatat lower altitudes where there is a denser total amount of co2 molecules this means its more likely a photon of infrared radiation will warm the atmospherebut above a certain altitude the free path to space that is the ability of a photon to travel too space without meeting a co2 molecule increases so that most of the photons leave the atmospheremore co2 above this altitude increases the ability of the atmosphere to loose heat its like layers of spheres so the volume increases much quicker than the amount of co2 so the altitude remains sort of the samethis means the upper atmosphere is cooling due to more co2 hot gas expands cool gas contractsthis is why the upper atmosphere is cooling and shrinkingplease note to respondents this is an eli5 its not a graduate level explanation before someone says its more complex than thatampx200bedited this can be a bit tricky so if the op does not understand all of it highlight the bit they do not understand when asking a question about it,1

its pretty impressive how many people dont understand what they did and think they just made spaghetti or smthshapedhollow pasta like macaroni or cascatelli take up space and cant pack together efficiently the researchers have developed basically origami pasta its flat when dry to save space but unfolds when cooked into a fixed shape depending on the type of pasta you want allows for efficient packaging so more pasta per box or smaller boxes less packaging waste,1

where does pm25 come fromthere are outdoor and indoor sources of fine particles outside fine particles primarily come from car truck bus and offroad vehicle eg construction equipment snowmobile locomotive exhausts other operations that involve the burning of fuels such as wood heating oil or coal and natural sources such as forest and grass fires fine particles also form from the reaction of gases or droplets in the atmosphere from sources such as power plants these chemical reactions can occur miles from the original source of the emissions in new york state some of the fine particles measured in the air are carried by wind from outofstate sources because fine particles can be carried long distances from their source events such as wildfires or volcanic eruptions can raise fine particle concentrations hundreds of miles from the eventpm25 is also produced by common indoor activities some indoor sources of fine particles are tobacco smoke cooking eg frying sautéing and broiling burning candles or oil lamps and operating fireplaces and fuelburning space heaters eg kerosene heaters source,1

not necessarily tiny particles are usually always an issue bakersflour mill lung is a problem as well breathing in lots of flour dust over long periods of time the small size of the particles cause them to get lodged in the distal airways and the cumulative immune response with continued exposure causes fibrosis and scarring pneumoconiosis is a general term for most of those diseases some particulates cause greater immune response than others silica for example,1

i read an article talking about this a few weeks ago lost the source it was talking about how in most vaccines the first shot has your immune system learn the antibodies and it creates a few memory cells the booster shots are needed because without exposure to a rare oneoff exposure the immune system will decrease its memory cell count over time by using booster shots second shots the immune system will increase the amount of memory cells which will increase your immunity time is a important factor here too soon and the body confuses the booster with the original and there is trivial change in immunity to my understanding there isnt much of a problem with waiting longerhowever im not a medical professional and mrna vaccines could play by different rules,1

fwiw her research has been making major headways in the oncology cancer world theres been over a dozen studies on it that im familiar with and its been extraordinarily effective its just very hard to prescribe because it depends on knowing which specific proteins a given cancer is expressing which arent necessarily consistent for a cancer type or even for two tumors in the same patientthat baseline of safety and efficacy data is probably why people were starting to talk about it as an infectious disease vaccine by 2018 or soit might seem overbold to say but the way the research is trending she may very well have cured cancer for all functional purposes,1

you are proposing that the reaction function might have a discrete jump in it as spanking moves from mild to severe rather than being a continuous process this is not unreasonable but it is a datagathering nightmare people will not accurately report how severe their spanking is and it is one of those areas where i feel like the biases would be very hard to predictmodel the proxy of bad enough authorities noticed doesnt help for distinguishing between mild and medium casesim not saying we shouldnt attempt to consider such a model at some point but from a datagathering pointofview what you are proposing is very nontrivial so calling it scientific malpractice not to consider it is a bit over the top,1

anyone who has owned more than one dog at a time can tell you that dogs totaly get jealous how is this even disputed,1
so what i think will be charitably speaking casually hypothesising and uncharitably speaking speculationbut what you are describing sounds like it could work in a similar way to the effect known as anchoringin some anchoring experiments people are asked questions such as how many african countries are in the un and through various methods are provided with some numbers as reference points say 10 small or 65 bigit is generally found that when you receive a small anchor such as 10 you guess a that a smaller number of countries in the un are african if you receive a higher anchor you tend to guess larger numbers this bias seems to be very difficult to avoid even when the numbers come from completely random sources like a roulette wheel though i should mention that some recent experiments have made this randomness even more salient to participants and did not observe anchoring effectsnow this is just a hypothesiswhat could be happening is that even when you are annoyed by the instance of doublespeak it might succeed in setting an emotional anchor from which it is now difficult to depart this could contribute to doublespeak being especially perniciousbut this as a candidate mechanism would need to be specifically tested,1

in our system insulin is very nearly the ideal drug for the pharmaceutical companies insulindependent diabetics need to take it every day perhaps several times a die for as long as they live if they dont take it theyll die eventually and quite uncomfortably the drug companies could hardly have created a medication more suited to their greed i am sure theyve done the calculus to determine how much they can actually charge before people begin going without and the companies lose their client base am i cynical yes and after working in health care for 40 years i think im allowed to be such our health care industry is built on ruthless exploitation for profit from top to bottom and big pharma is the most mercenary im also very skeptical of any talk of reform because so much money is involved and so many people would stand to lose their very large shares of the pie if it were more equitable,1

people overestimate the effectiveness of competition in our society we tend to have a very specific idea of what competition is and how it operates but it doesnt apply that way to our society with its megacorps that have a stranglehold on industries often multiple at a time they can simply buy up a competitor or throw money to bury competitors instead of improving their product or lowering pricesadd the broken medical system and the necessity of the drug on top of the usual corporate bs and you have something that is unsurprisingly destructive the price of entry is high and the profits get pushed ever higher,1

its not the volume of injection thats the critical determinant the injection itself is mostly saline the key point is that a single dose of moderna vaccine contains 100 micrograms of mrna vs 30 micrograms in a pfizer dose that said there are differences in the formulation which might effect the efficiency of mrna uptake into the cells how stable the mrna is etc so its not as simple as saying theres 3x more stuff in a moderna dose,1

original study abstract narcissists have a relatively higher proclivity for displaying antisocial rather than prosocial behaviors suggesting a comparatively higher tendency for unfavorably impacting societies however maintenance of social order also depends on appropriate responses to others social behavior once we focus on narcissists as observers rather than actors their impact on social functioning becomes less clearcut theoretical arguments suggest that narcissists could be either hyporesponsive or hyperresponsive to others social behavior across four studies we examined narcissists responsiveness to variations in others antisocial and prosocial behaviors results showed that narcissists differentiated less between others antisocialityprosociality as reflected in their subsequent moral character evaluations studies 1–4 and reward and punishment studies 3 and 4 these results suggest that narcissists are hyporesponsive to others social behaviors implications and directions for future research are discussed,1
nobody was stripped of their masculinity im unsure what would lead you to this conclusionwhat it looks like the paper is saying is that the divergence of the denisovan y chromosome from the shared lineage was about 700 thousand years ago while neanderthal dna diverged from our own around 350 thousand years ago what this means is that there would have been greater similarities between the neanderthal y chromosome and the sapiens y chromosome because there was simply less time of separation for the divergence to accumulate — and indeed the paper shows neanderthal y is more similar to ours than to denisovan y having more similar dna means there is a greater likelihood for successful reproduction as complete speciation has not yet occurred despite the classical interpretation of sapiens outcompeting neanderthals i believe it is actually unlikely that a genocide took place in this manner the understanding of neanderthals not as cavemen but as every bit as clever and capable as us is increasingly compelling it is most likely that the sapiens of the time would have recognised neanderthals as not dissimilar from themselves given that they could speak and create art and music and thus were capable of communication furthermore this probably led to interaction between the groups as early sapiens learned about their new environment from neanderthals who were accustomed to the area and already knew where to fish or find good stone for toolmaking even if the groups did not integrate they certainly had a degree of contact as evidenced by the many many interbreeding events over a lengthly time periodthere have been theories that perhaps one of the reasons we have mainly female neanderthal dna is because only the offspring of male sapiens x female neanderthal was viable that perhaps the neanderthal y was ltjust different enoughgt that children of female sapiens x male neanderthal either did not survive or were sterile so ending their line and not passing on this neanderthal y its possible that this is why or that perhaps mixed children remained with their neanderthal mothers and therefore over time created a genetic shift where the sapiens y eventually replaced the neanderthal y neanderthal x remained unchanged within the population for this to occur the sapiens y would have needed to have a selection advantage over the neanderthal y if hybrid offspring of neanderthal y were inviable or sterile perhaps this would have been enough of a disadvantage over time — especially in a situation where the separate groups are slowly becoming more integrated —to alter the distribution neanderthals lived in smaller family groups than sapiens too so its entirely possible that we lost the neanderthal y due to inviability and then simply watered down the remaining neanderthal dna with our own as we reabsorbed them back into our group kind of like when an island species dna bottlenecks and creates divergence but they are still similar enough to the mainland population that if you reintroduce them interbreed and only retain the island pops useful allele variations such as a new colour in this case we retained a few useful variations such as pale skin better vit d absorption in colder climates red hair better pain tolerance also a big sexy selection factor longerpointier noses better for cold dry air etc,1

wow i thought this was a joke but no thats a direct quote from the paper it was literally funded by an association that stands to directly benefit from the conclusions of this poorly designed metaanalysisthey specifically looked for studies that showed a clear difference between meat abstainers and meat consumers without regard to what other factor may have caused that differencethey even intentionally left out studies if they included specifics about how much meat was eaten that seems like a convenient way to leave out specific studies that dont support their conclusion,1

in my country theres a opposition party that actively challenged a statistic provided by a government institution thats independent of the current government they caught so much flak for it since it actively undermined an institution thats held in high regard its important relevant statistical information regarding the population of a nation is provided by an independent institution to dismiss any semblence of partisanship weve got a similar setup where party programs get factchecked by an agency that operates independent of government and as such has credibility is there a similar agency in the us,1

hmm this reminds me of a miniproject my students completed in an honors course i taught a few years ago in it students correlated behaviors and lifestyle choices with perceptions of mental health there was a moderate correlation r061 p0023 n159 between vegetarianvegan choice diets and willingness to pursue mental healthcare and an inverse correlation r073 p0016 n152 between that diet choice and mental healthcare stigma the studentdesigned project had some methodological flaws but it does present an interesting idea given this studys results were meat abstainers simply more willing to admit to depression and anxiety than meat eaters,1

i find camerason to be helpful body language contributes to discussions especially when theres a few different people and you need to know whos got something to say next or how everyone feels about what you just said this is what faces are forin the most functional zoom meetings people are either looking at the camera all the time because they are actively participating and so they are genuinely paying attention and talking or they are less core to the meeting they are participating occasionally and they are not looking at the camera all the time they are onscreen but clearly doing other things on their computer and thats fine at least at my workplace i think this is the best way cameras are on which makes meetings more effective but people are allowed to multitask noone is expected to silently fakesmile at their screen for an hour,1
sorry but causes fatigue in every participant outweighs speaker finds it demotivatingi find this objection particularly weird because its not like im looking at peoples faces when im doing an inperson lecture or meeting were usually looking at slides or notes or somethingand if someone is giving me a creepy stare inperson at least i can tell a camera right up in your face for two hours is much more intrusive,1

i feel like im blind or something i cant see the link to said study in that article can you point it out for me,1
when you are in person people only look at you occasionally during the meeting when you are speaking when their attention naturally diverts elsewhere eg their laptop or another person it gives you small moments to relax and not be 100 alertwhen you are in zoom you have no idea if anyone is looking at you so you assume someone may be watching the whole entire time because of this you are constantly in high alert thats the difference for me anyway having camera on is tiring and i switch it on and off depending if the topic is in my scope,1

but how do you handle actual in person meetings then where you cant stare at yourself constantly it seems like if youre self conscious to this extent where turning off the selffacing view wouldnt help your problem is your baseline anxiety not the meeting method,1

interesting im female introverted in it and much prefer to have my camera on i and everyone really communicate a lot via facial expressions and gestures and i get insecure when i know the others wont get 50 of what i communicate words alone are not my strong suit i prefer to make a full impression for the same reason i prefer it when everyone is on camera i also really dont mind seeing myself on camera maybe its because im just used to sitting together virtually unless its a onepersonpresentation or a stupid meeting where you are not even needed but i dont generally have those,1

this occurred to me as well instances of bullying had a high correlation with my friend groups and how we rated the older i got and spent time with niche circles the less i encountered anyone of this sort the errant few were extreme outliers with lots of social problems and if i recall didnt last long in their schools i attended my point is just this research no doubt captures some of the story but from my anecdotal experience at least which has virtually no value here this wasnt the case,1
yes and i always think about how exhausting it must be i had a so that was this way she would come home daily with a new social gripe of how someone slighted her by not inviting her to this or that how someone walked past her and didnt say hello etc it put me completely on edge i just dont notice that stuff i admit to being socially introverted and unaware but to know that there are people that are 100 keeping social score yikes,1

ill make an educated guess since this applies to most people on reddit and assume you just werent very high on the totem pole which weeded out this sort of bullying behaviorin other words if you were cooler you would have been friends with people who were actively doing this if you were totally uncool you might have had friends and friendsoffriends who were all socially unsuccessful and either as a cause or correlation they didnt engage in bullying behavior,1

it could be a proximity thing that is a person who is bullied will be bullied by someone in their proximity rather than at random which seems obvious so it might be a ‘ friend or someone else nearby i dont know how deep it would go because everyone in a class is either a friend or a friend of a friend unless a school is really large,1

a big red flag i had in a previous relationship was how she was sort of like this very astutely aware of any perceived slights against her and a driving need to get even with anybody who did which she constantly kept telling me about almost any conversation with her would after 10 minutes or so devolve into her complaining about people who had slighted her in some way and she wanted to get back at them or how her friends from back home were all such losers and not doing anything with their lives i mean literally every conversation she was also one of those people who had to always tell you about this guy was totally creeping on me today to make sure you knew that someone found her attractive that relationship didnt last too long,1

its a quixotic endeavor to form groups to do good but humanity relies on such people to counterbalance however in a minimum way all the evil made by others of course there are always egos frictions between the aims of the members those people are also humans but many many times they succeed in making the group strong and cohesive based on personal ethics,1
youre talking about rebalancing the internalized rewards of the behavior in individuals via their environment which doesnt sound cheesy to me id add that the internalized consequences of bullying can be reinforced as well by teaching kids to be selfaware about their own social drives and the shortcuts theyll be tempted to take before they reach an age where they may pick up the behavior once bullying becomes habit theyre already building rationalizations to defend those behaviors not seeking an alternative that values mutual respect or love and kindness,1

wow i always felt like my experience was more akin to teasing because it was a friend of mine it went on for years and it was super fucked up the fact that my trust and desire to fit in was exploited manipulated to bully me for years killed my self esteem and emotional well being more so than if it would have been a stranger or acquaintancemy friend was doing this kind of stuff to climb the social ladder and it worked it happened almost exclusively when in a group of people whereas he was nice when it was just me and him its kind of weird because he grew out of it and we grew to be much better friends as adults still someone i talk to fairly regularly i dont condone what he did but i have a difficult time holding it against him and i dont think he is a bad person by any means,1
dont you enjoy it when a scientific study statistically validates something youve know for literally years,1
yeah you kind of opened yourself up for that one did the bullies arrange formal duels with you and wait for your consent to fight or did they just attack you,1
oof the savagerythat being said america really doesnt stand up against many places outside of europe as well,1
yeah i dont think its less complex or dangerous in boys where weve set up a situation where you can be openly mocked but it has been predetermined that it is in good fun so if you are hurt by it you are the one that has broken the social contract and your group status is lowered,1
sounds like a great place to not work good on your friend for defending himself,1
no the step in the right direction is to fix the problem you just complained about stop punishing retaliation how can you point out that problem and then look in a completely different direction for the solution,1

bullies and popular kids often the same have much better social skills than the victims of bullying they know to ingratiate themselves with teachers and they know how theyre better communicators and conversationalists,1
as a teen who was made fun of a lot i definitely made fun of another kid to gain some cool guy points once so i can definitely see that i regretted it when the guy found out though,1

makes sense before i transferred to a better school with much better friends in middle school my old friends at my old school turned into total bullies my socalled friends turned on me because i was going to a different school and made my 7th grade year terrible funny thing is there was a stigma that once you left my old school and started going to the private school my new school you turned into a prep and thought you were too good for the public school crowd funny thing is im not the one who changed they did and they wondered why i didnt want to talk to them after i left,1

i believe that the little book how to lie with statistics should be mandatory readingi once forwarded several copies of this book to an engineering firm that was issuing misleading graphics concerning a public project they were engaged to work on i didnt oppose the project just the misleading graphics they read the book and changed their graphics,1
bullies tend to have traits like charm they are intentional in their manipulation of the environment and they are often able to help control the classroom environment ie they can get the other kids to behave newer teachers teachers who themselves either consciously or un want to be liked accidentally bond to all of this bullies are almost never sid from toy story they are trickybullying programs dont work because they dont address the social currency and structures of school great you debugged and walked away now you have to navigate the difficulties of being unprotected unallied and very possibly explicitly ostracized plus you feel weak conscious pairing of students in classrooms explicit activities to devalue popularity and spread the idea of strength in a variety of talents could go a long way i cringe when i see a teacher tell kids to find a partneralso and then ill get off my soapbox i wish we better equipped kids with strong responses to bullies my dream is to one day get my phd and write a book called no you shut up a compendium of skills and explicit retorts for every age to help parents and teachers help kids to self advocate and feel empowered to stand up to bullies,1
that will never happen,1
i wonder if these same mechanisms continue to apply throughout adulthood where the victims include family and colleagues as well and the methods of bullying become less physical and more covert social hierarchies dont end with schools so why would bullying,1

it also takes kids recognizing the impact of their behaviormy school tried an experimental approach where one time midway through the year everyone filled out an anonymous sheet listing kids you considered bullies how severe a bully whywhat you had seen them doexperienced who you had seen them bully etc if your name came up a certain number of times it had to be a lot you had to speak with a counselor about it they wouldnt say what names or anything had come up it would just be basically do you know other students consider you a bully did you know that when you examples of behavior people might laugh but it makes them not trust you or want to be real friends with yousome kids who were total assholes were unaffected but many bullies didnt realize that what they thought was just clowning around and getting a reaction from people was behavior that made others see them as an asshole one of the most problematic kids i knew broke down crying he felt so bad about it his behavior totally turned around for the better obviously it didnt solve all the bullying problems but as part of a multifaceted approach encouraging genuine awareness of ones social image was very powerful,1

you need to be careful with that though because it is becoming a highly oversaturated market there are other issues with the market that i dont think teachers would face it is usually the first place companies look to cut costs if we started to actually prioritize them but it is something youd want to keep an eye on or youd end up back where you started but youll be paying more for it very few jobs will try and optimize their workforce if they just end up with mediocre staff so after a while new passionate and good teachers wouldnt be able to find their way into the market because teachers unions can make it difficult to fire someone without cause ampx200bampx200bthat being said im not saying dont raise teacher pay i just think we need to be aware that there might be other adjustments needed to the hiring process in addition to increased pay,1
it really pains me to think about the kind of advancements we couldve made by now if stem cell research was properly funded and allowed from the get go,1
i wonder if that amount would go up if the child does more of the care for the dog ive always assumed that dogs tend to be more interested in their primary caretaker if a child goes into the kitchen it probably means nothing if an adult goes into the kitchen it might be dinner time or time for a walk or whatever kids sometimes do interesting stuff but dogs still know where their bread is buttered,1
thats amazing to hear im glad your wife and you are doing better,1
seems quite promising but its important to be aware that there are a few negatives to this report as with most im sure and at least the researchers involved are quite honest about its shortcomings people tend to have a kneejerk emotional reaction to news like this and this is exactly the kind of reporting that will cause hysterically angry parents to demand a week down the line that their paralyzed child receive an immediate stem cell infusion when its not considered the current standard of care anywhere in the world i certainly wouldnt consider doing it at this stage any adverse event leaves you critically medicolegally exposedfirstly these are all patients with cervical central cord syndrome which does typically have a better prognosis for spontaneous recovery than most spinal cord injuries secondly the patients they included are all relatively young fewer than 10 of them over 60 whereas most patients who sustain spinal cord injuries from sudden hyperextension are in the older cohort and older patients tend to show less recovery than younger ones so the scivoletto population study might not be an accurate comparison thirdly this is not a controlled study simply an observational one compared to previously published population outcomesthe most important finding was the absence of adverse effects in this small study and this definitely paves the way for a formal controlled study and hopefully the eventual inclusion of msc in spinal cord injury management protocols from what i can see it seems relatively straightforward and probably quite affordable bone marrow harvest extract and culture stem cells infuse intravenously and certainly something that could be done with relative ease in most spinal centres one asia grade makes a giant difference to functional capacity and the likelihood for independence,1
was wondering the same thing i took care of my dogs as a kid and my dogs lived for me,1
all the other areas of biomedical research sadly have similar problems overwhelming regulations and distorted funding incentives,1
when my children were born over 25 yrs ago there was a program that allowed you to store their umbilical cord cryogenically to preserve their stem cells in case they needed them in the future if i had had the money i would have done it i wonder if anyone else did,1
i dont know if thats really true i almost exclusively feed my two dogs because one has very particular diet needs and its easier if one person keeps track but id swear theyre more excited to see my husband when he gets home like they love me and i love them but hes the one thats fun im the one thats making them do tricks and sit before their meal and wait for the healthy dinner time,1
bacteriophages being one example i understand the concern that they might mutate in the patients body understand in the sense of that i understand why that prospect may be frightening i dont claim to understand the mechanics of microbiology its not my field of expertise but thats exactly why i think we need more research on the topic if we could weaponize phages against bacteria safely it would be a massive breakthrough in medicine,1
gt that they do so more than they would with adultsyou misread that it was the opposite the dogs synchronized less with the children,1
this is incredible im so sorry you both went through all that its brutal i really appreciate your honesty about how deeply this affected you congrats on the stem cell surgery its amazing with my 3rd i banked my sons umbilical chord stem cells it goes into a public bank like with blood donation i didnt before because banking for yourself the kid as opposed to public was like 10000 i think it was way too expensive for me then with the 3rd i found out about the public one im happy for you both,1
well the fun parent is usually the one who is around less because the primary caregiver is also the primary disciplinarian whereas the other parent mostly just does the fun parts when they see you they like you but they also know its possible youre about to give them a bath so its more cautious you said when he gets home which also lead me to assume that he spends more time away from home than you do if thats the case then his attention may also be more of a rarity than yours and therefore more sought after if youre home all day then hanging with you may feel like less of a treat small children often do that sort of thing too these are just hypothesis though it could be a lot of different factors dogs are extremely social and so are we but youre probably right that its not just a matter of foodit would be interesting if you and your husband switched jobs for a week if he did the feedingtraining andor if you left the house more often while he stayed home its possible that you might be the fun one,1
no the study found that dogs mirror children less than adults im guessing you misread the title since several other people apparently have,1

without having the exact details known here are some thoughts for you1 mimicking the receptor does not mean that its a functional replacement they might have devised something with similar binding epitopes to trick the virusthat said2 the ace2 receptor to my understanding is found on surfaces like the cell lining of the lungs and more i assume that if the mimicry they designed is similar enough to trick the normal receptor ligand ang iang ii then this dilution of ligand reaching true receptor is acceptable the effects may be minimal if any or nonthreatening when used in a short term treatment course as this would suggestnot everything in the body has a dire impact if its manipulated to some degree but the complexity and potential outcomes of even the most safe seeming drugs is why we require extensive clinical testing,1

im not as informed about this topic as id like to be my understanding is that the objections to stem cell research were specifically about embryonic stem cells wouldnt it be difficultimpossible to treat someone with stem cells from their own embryo were there also moral objections to other types of stem cell research that slowed the development of this kind of treatment also is that even an issue since the discovery of the yamanaka factors,1

i almost got into a lab like this theres research going on looking at bacteriophages in bacterial infection therapy as well as utilizing them for medication transport and cancer therapy apparently most of the initial research was only being performed by the navy and has recently been getting more and more attention with the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria the issue is because theyre viruses that actively mutate although never been known to cause human disease you can not say exactly what the virus is at any given point meaning proteins structure and genetic changes secondary to mutations and because of that regulation makes it difficult to move to human trial,1

dogs can also recognize that children are young they know what being a child means just like they know that puppies are different than adult dogs they expect and tolerate different behaviors in human children than they would in a human adult for example and some dogs are more protective of children since they recognize them as more vulnerable so even if they adult isnt necessarily their alpha so to speak they probably recognize that the child is not the one calling the shots around here,1

youre misinformed youre thinking of embryonic stem cells during the bush administration one they didnt ban it it was limited to existing lines in the usa only two embryonic stem cells didnt really live up to the hype three great progress in adult stem cells was made and most of the research focuses on these four you want to use your own stem cells anyway to avoid rejection unless you want to do cloning,1

why is socialism more extremist than capitalism,1
ppl dont understand that radicals on the right and radicals on the left are lightyears apart right wing radicals want white supremacy leftwing radicals want workers to own the means of production and an end to exploitation but nah theyre the same,1
what does a moderate political view entail anyway ive often seen the propaganda of that term used in a vague handwaving effort towards sustaining the status quo with little concrete thought beyond that it seems to me the term is often a political phrase used by the powerful to endorse policy that sustains their power more than it has to do with the actual values or vision of people as democracies should support after all as such the term has grown on me like placebo pills one would give to an asylum take this its good for you its moderateif moderate political views are culpable for where we are it has a lot of explaining to do regarding sustainability thats probably why it has endorsed a trajectory leading to its own ideological destruction these leading institutions andor ideologies that are ultimately responsible for the unsustainable results we witness on issues pertaining to covid climate change economics among many other valid concerns must sustain such criticism and given they fail to satisfy such concerns support for such powerful systems die even the concept of determining power that moderate politics claims to uphold democracy now wavers in support under the trajectory moderate politics has endorsed does moderate politics have a sustainability problem the answer is a clear yes to me and the culpability for that to be possible must similarly lay in the same powerful moderate hands,1

hahah this comment flew over their headalways someone else and never themselves,1
i think its safe to say that burning people is objectively wrong and isnt merely about a different moral system,1
disagreejust because its common doesnt make it evil,1
i mean calling someone evil doesnt negate that there are people less evil than them there are plenty of steps between evil and not evili dont really agree with the goodevil dichotomy but i dont think calling someone evil is a case of blackwhite thinking,1
so the one in the op seems to be specifically based on extreme pro group attitudes so you could probably reduce that to be extreme forms of tribalism such as white supremacy etc but it also includes violence endorsement against out groupsi think the point here with an example is that terrorists are not necessarily psychopathic but more that they have been radicalized into a certain way of thinking there is probably a fundamental difference that we as non professional psychopathologists dont know of,1

i dont think seeing the benefits of capitalism is an extremist view not sure of your point there but in terms of what reddit is looking for to feel superior to the conservative mindset the study associates conservatism with caution of evidence on a perceptual level and dogmatism associated with speed of evidence obtained so of course in the article they try their absolute hardest to bring the delayed processing from caution in conservatism with the impulsivity in dogmatism to conclude extremist views are just conservatives with dogmatic mindsets when the study shows extremists simply have impaired processing and impulsivity rather than caution and reduced risk taking measures in conservatism,1

thankfully and luckily that is the case similarly the real cost of insulin is only slightly more expensive than that but for the consumer the cost is magnitudes higher,1
theres also something very peculiar about this framing no our health and wellbeing is framed as not an end in itself but a means to improve the economy the whole reason that improving the economy is supposed to be a good thing is that we hope it would have a knockon effect of improving peoples health and wellbeing,1
that would be a brilliant idea they could call it medicare for everyone surely no one would object to everyonebeing healthier and happier,1
gtincreasing healthy life expectancy by just 26 years could result in a 83 trillion value to the economybecause people will be working longer geez we already work until were 67,1
even from a sheer greed standpoint its more profitable to sell to a wider audiencethere are 2755 billionaires if you charge them 8 figures for an aging treatment so 10000000 you get 275bn in total revenue there are 8 billion people in the world if you charge them 500 for an aging treatment you get 4tn over 100x more the idea of these treatments costing in the realm of 8 figures annually just isnt realistic thankfully but yeah the only factor is time,1

gtsinclairits funny coz i just watched invincible and there was a dude called da sinclair that was basically saying the same thing the difference is that his solution was to make people cyborgs he was doing bad stuff though,1
exceptfirst of all youre ignoring costs maybe the drugs are very complex to manufacture and require careful dosing and supervision which actually costs thousands of dollars per month or whatever secondly you cant just pick the two extremes companies use yield management to come up with the most profitable prices in various situations which means that giving it to 10 of the population at 5000 is more profitable than 100 of the population at 4000 once you factor in costs logistics licensing etc if you were right then chemo in america would be a lot cheaper,1

workers rise up comrade,1
this frustrates me we already have a simple proven method for reducing future healthcare costs and improving outcomes for people over 65 that is to make sure they have access to comprehensive healthcare in their youth if referring to early and easy preventative care garners more attention by calling it antiaging works then i guess i dont oppose a language switch but i do oppose attempts to slide something else into its place that has such great potential to be monetized and restricted to the wealthy its really this simple though if a young person has health concerns that they cant afford to seek treatment for the problem will usually get worse with age leading to higher treatment costs overall when they age into medicare and worse outcomes the 30year old diabetic rationing insulin if they survive becomes a 65year old with poorly controlled diabetes higher risk of gangrene higher or lower bmi and unnecessary damage to all of their metabolic systems every single disease process works like this almost every affliction associated with our elders begins long before we turn 65 and early diagnoses leads to early intervention leads to better and less expensive outcomes,1
this system would exist inside human cells the proteins and targeting strands would effectively wait inside the cell doing nothing until covid or other target viral rna was present which they would then silence cuthow long this system could persist and how it would be delivered is something that i and the authors dont know about the study was done on a petri dish and trying to figure out how to safely and effectively replicate it in a human being is a large part of why they say the technology is still years outthe goal is something like taking penicillin for a bacterial infection when you have the virus you put the antiviral into your body it hangs around long enough to shut down the virus but is eventually broken downmetabolized,1
this is incorrect as per the article gt they used an enzyme called crisprcas13b that attaches to specific rna sequences on the sarscov2 and degrades the genome it requires to replicate within human cellsthis is what crispr evolved to do it was a bacterial defense against viruses which functioned by storing viral dna sequences and cutting them to deactivate those viruses while the biotechnology is much better known for its geneediting capabilities it should be unsurprising that it can be applied as a viral defense tool as well,1

gtand not because it will make a few people a bunch of money,1
of course the economy is why we should be working to increase life span not you know the increased life span,1
melatonin is even cheaper is natural and slows down aging mechanisms ​of melatonin in antiaging and its regulation effects in radiationinduced premature senescence,1

possibly theres a concept known as compression of morbidity where people wouldnt live longer per say but wouldnt be infirm for as long before dying ie people would still die at 80 but theyd crash hard at 75 instead of going downhill in their 60sto what extent this would be reflective of reality is undetermined,1

tools that increase healthspan in animal models compress deteriorationdysfunction at old age assuming no further advancements and just those treatments reaching humans then not only would people live longer but once they reach the point of becoming old and frail they die quickly after that rather than dragging on for 1020 years like they do now so you live to 100 and die within a couple years rather than living to 80 and then dying within 20 yearsbeyond that there are additional advancements under research that are quite promising that suggest we may be able to actually stop aging entirely or potentially turn aging backward rejuvenate people this is still bleeding edge research but if successful it would completely obliterate aging from human society and thus the associated costs,1

most of the people who work in the field of aging desire to improve quality of life of humans they arent in it for the money most could have chosen alternative career paths or branched out into the corporate world and made a whole lot more however when you are appealing to governments for research funding you have to show that solving this problem will save the government money,1

this totally depends on the question a lot of lessthanintelligent people make very bold proclamations about statistics based on things they heard in their first year of university that apply to very specific questions and experimental designs six participants is indeed few and would make it difficult to reliably and accurately all but the most large and consistent differences between groups of this size 280 scans across 6 people is an incredible amount of scans likely requiring six figures worth of funding to generate and provides a lot of statistical power for detecting subtle longitudinal withinsubject changes with 6 participants and a lot of covariates this is a powerful dataset for searching for signals and planning future experiments it also provides a reasonably strong basis for the expected withinindividual fluctuations of various neuroimaging over time,1
removed,1
what we are seeing in animal models is that there is compressed morbidity this means that if you can extend healthspan by 3 years but there is no change on maximum lifespan which is what we see with a number of therapies then you end up with fewer years of illhealth at the end in an idealized situation you can imagine living to 100 and then rapidly deteriorating over the course of 1 year and dying sometime within that the healthcare costs would just be for that last year of rapid decline rather than from ages 80 to 100,1

so maybe focus on increasing quality of life for the population such as how we transport ourselves how our homes are built what food is allowed to be processed and created and actual labor protections so people dont die just because profit idk maybe we should push for real regulations on business that have a direct impact on our daily lives since they own everythingn,1
but how can targeting aging not just push the whole issue down the road a few years ok people will age slower but the idea that theyll die healthy so to speak isnt made a reality by any of thislike sure you slow down aging great but the last 15 years of peoples lives will be spent dodging illness after illness no matter what you do because thats what getting old is,1

people across cultures can tell when others are in the early stages of infection by looking at themartin arshamian at the karolinska institute in stockholm sweden and his colleagues tested whether it was possible to tell if someone was sick just by looking at their facethe team worked with 169 volunteers from six different cultural backgrounds including city dwellers in stockholm and huntergatherers in the rainforests of thailand and malaysia and in the coastal deserts of mexico each volunteer was shown photos of swedish people taken 2 hours after they had been injected with either escherichia coli or a placebothose who had been injected with e coli were at the beginning stages of an immune response when their photos were taken – and some of the volunteers in all six groups had a betterthanchance ability to identify that they were sickthe ability to tell who is sick at an early stage could benefit us by helping us decide whether to avoid certain people says joshua tybur at vu university amsterdam in the netherlands this could also be useful for people you care about to know when they need more help he says,1
thats only if you get to retire i wouldnt bet on itanyway there is something else to consider here getting old and frail means more medical costs for you and more medical resources used on you and if you can avoid using those resources technically you are saving money of course youll still spend that money somewhere else so its not like that money is disappearing in either case,1
retirement is very expensive it seems extremely improbable that any mass produced cocktail of drugs could have costs of manufacture exceeding the costs of living without working for over a decade and politically improbable that the patent holders would be permitted or have so little sense as to use monopoly power to price it out of mass deployment pharma execs dont want the entire patent regime to be actually repealed after all so while there would be profits only within the bounds of not provoking too much outrage so any actual cure for aging will be paid for since it would permit people to just keep working something that just got you another five years more of a problem,1

a healthy lifestyle isnt freecheap part of what grinds people into the ground is the need for money to pay for the things to give them a healthy lifestyle like gym memberships for example but because youre working you can only visit the gym at specific times which means you need to push other things around then it just becomes an endless shuffle of reorganizing because 8 hours of your day is booked upbasically until people figure out a way to revolutionize life meaning work politics family life food medicine etc its going to be time money or health pick two,1
while ade is possible with any vaccine it is very rare and that is something that they are looking for there are a few medical acronyms of ade so im assuming you mean antibodydependent enhancement where the antibodies make it easier not harder for the virus to get in if it were happening you would see worse covid cases in vaccinated persons we have seen the opposite vaccinated persons get sick at a much much lower rate and have mild cases if they do get sick at this point there have been zero cases of ade associated with any of the various covid vaccines,1

if you can reverse it by definition you have done better than stopping it you can definitely stop and reverse aging other animals do it we even do it in a sense while were young if you could stop the dna turning off all the stuff that protects our cells while were young it would continue to protect our cells perpetually senescence is programmed in our dna we are programmed to become frail and die if you can turn off that programming you can stop that processnow its possible there are some processes beyond the scope of dna so long as you can continuously correct emerging errors and stop the methylation process that changes dna expression as we age in theory there is no reason you couldnt remain young forever this can be proven somewhat empirically by looking at the wide range of life expectancies among mammals and noting that age related degeneration happens in much the same way just at different times also that there is such variation suggests the genetic tweaks required to change this programming are actually fairly simple,1
pushups situps squats lunges running etc are all free you dont need a gym membership to be fit access to healthy food is a whole different beast though,1
from what i have read most scientists in the field seem to think that it is possible to slow andor reverse aging but not stop it per se the reasoning behind this is the fact that you can not stop the biological processes that actually cause damage as you age eg metabolism breathing but you can clean up the damage after it happens,1

i came here to ask an eli5 but yeah i guess if theyre separating the cause of covid restrictions from the cause of unemployment benefits being raised due to covid restrictions then the title makes sense but thats splitting a fine hairincreased unemployment benefits didnt affect the employment rate because people were already unemployed due to the covid lock downs which prompted the extra unemployment benefits,1
it isnt hair splitting at all you need to have been fired downsized or otherwise involuntarily separated from your employment to qualify for unemployment benefits in other words you dont get unemployment if you quit your job,1

most all states allow you to quit your job and collect unemployment this is because unemployment is paid out for involuntary loss of a job whatever the cause if your employer tells you now youre a night shift employee the law sees this as functionally equivalent to getting fired from your day shift job and offered a night shift position in that case saying i quit is actually just declining a different job after being fired so you do qualify for unemployment this happens in a lot of cases if you are assigned a more dangerous task if you have an hour or pay cut or anything else that results in different responsibilities these can typically be rebuffed by the employer by offering the old position back there are other ones too where it might apply like your spouse moving for a new job so you have to quit or you having a child so you have to quit they are not caused by your employer but they are at least viewed as involuntary and make you eligible for unemploymentso for antivax people yea if your job already requires that you get vaccinated likes hospital they can require it and id you decline you get fired and cant get fired because that was already a job requirement when you were hired but if they add it on later thats involuntary and yea you should be able to collectas for not looking for jobs im not aware of anywhere that isnt requiring you look for a job when a vaccine is readily available california reinstated the requirements this week,1

as an aquarium hobbyist i really hate the aquarium hobby sometimes research your pets people figure out how to take care of them the correct way and understand the commitment if you cant rehome them then euthanize the nature of modernity makes it so anyone just trying to salve their conscience by releasing a pet into a local waterway could be inadvertently introducing an animal capable of outcompeting local wildlife if youve got a fish or other aquatic animal that you can not rehome please euthanize it doesnt take a lot isolate the animal in a container and dose the proper amount of clove oil to put it into torpor and behead it trust me the difficult emotional nature of doing so is much less than the impact of altering an entire ecosystem,1

not really they are actually different terms in ecology invasive nonnative and destructive nonnative just nonnative for example apis mellifera is the species people have come to know and love as the honeybee they originated from europe but in north america they are not typically though of as invasive even though they actually do outcompete native solitary bees sometimes and can act invasive depending on the region house sparrows are nonnative also from europe but now theyre all over north america and have become naturalized,1

while its nice someone looked at this human fertility is incredibly complicated and maternal immune interaction with the fetus is an ongoing issue from about a week after implantation when this study conveniently ends and thus sidesteps actually demonstrating anything at all all the way to it being time for mom and dad to argue about whether they should have skipped that lamaze classin short if you want to demonstrate that this process is still working youre going to have to observe it all the way to the dirty diaper and in fact a couple weeks beyond that for complicated reasonsfortunately someone appears to have done this very thing which while the study authors acknowledged that the sample size and control may be problematic it pretty well demonstrates that yes baby was made and both miscarriage and infant mortality rates were within norms for the ustldr while these guys were faffing about splitting verrrry tiny hairs someone else combed through the vsafe data and confirmed that netflix and chill is still resulting in purchases of both huggies and their offbrand equivalents at the expected rate,1
well lets see after ww2 us was the only major economy left intact the us helped rebuild places such as germany then in the early 1990s globalization esp of labor really took off germany was again rebuilding with the fall of the berlin wall what germany did well was protect their base labor force and manufacturing the us outsourced additionally germany has an extremely strong union system since so few have college degrees and are trained in trades of some sort when the us was mostly a manufacturing and export powerhouse future generations did well when it shifted to debt fueled economy and domestic service sector the possibility of doing better than previous generations died debt is the destroyer,1

i saw this article earlier and was reading it just now btw the original study is here its open accessanyhow i found the idea of death penalty selfreinforcement interesting they quote a previous article that says once an office assembles a staff that has handled a capital trial it draws upon this capacity to pursue the death penalty in subsequent cases which further augments the offices institutional capacity to pursue the death penalty this selfreinforcing dynamic between capacity and caseload makes it more likely for offices that obtain death sentences to seek the death penalty going forward conversely offices that cease to obtain death penalties or never obtained death penalties in the first place may be less likely to reverse course as institutional capacity for death penalty sentencing erodes or is never developed this path dependency may reflect practices of prosecutors who make the charging decisions whether to seek the death penalty but it may also capture defense lawyering judges jurors and other features of a county that make it more likely to continue to death sentence over time,1
because climate change is so slow people become acclimatized to whatever the next stage is and the next and its un uphill battle to remind them this isnt normal,1
i think this study and the data used need to be contextualizedthe survey was created because in part no largescale national surveys measured gender identity at the time they generally still dont hell the us census also asks no questions about gender identity so we have no true population estimates of trans individuals side note the same is true for sexual identity though they ask about living with a samesex partnera communitybased nonrespondent driven sample of 28000 trans respondents has enormous value to our understanding of the diverse experiences of trans people in the us it can not tell us about loss to followup selfselection bias and other major issues with survey design but neither can the largescale national surveys we use to understand population prevalence in drug use for example nsduh it would be grossly unethical to randomize trans participants to surgery versus treatment as usual so this analysis existing is interesting and important that is not to say its without flaws just that the rush to condemn survey research among an underresearched population is dangerous and antiscience,1

this tracks with a survey that foundgtwe find that african americans are more responsive to argument frames that are both racial ie the death penalty is unfair because most of the people who are executed are black and nonracial ie too many innocent people are being executed than are whites who are highly resistant to persuasion and in the case of the racial argument actually become more supportive of the death penalty upon learning that it discriminates against blackspersuasion and resistance race and the death penalty in americamark peffley and jon hurwitz american journal of political science vol 51 no 4 oct 2007,1

question based on how the data was collected how valid are the findingsquote in this study we performed a secondary analysis of data from the 2015 us transgender survey the largest existing data set containing comprehensive information on the surgical and mental health experiences of tgd people the survey was conducted across 50 states washington dc us territories and us military bases abroad a total of 27 715 tgd adults took the us transgender survey which was disseminated by communitybased outreach from august 19 2015 to september 21 2015so there are two things that seem to stand out first the survey was disseminated by communitybased outreach which seems to indicate that if a certain person was not in contact with communitybased outreach they would not have been part of the surveysecond it seems reasonable to assume that not everyone who was contacted as part of the survey did actually replyif we take both parts into account how likely is it that the results are affected by this is it reasonable to assume that a people who feel positive about genderaffirming surgeries are more likely to be in contact with communitybased outreach and b that people who feel positive about genderaffirming surgeries were more likely to replyor is it more likely that people who felt negative were more likely to reply if we are talking about business customer satisfaction it is well established that people who had negative experiences are substantially more likely to voice their opinionso based on the data they had how valid are the findungs,1

great comment and excellent contextualization i have one quibble which i would be interested to get your view on you say that it would be grossly unethical to randomize trans participants to surgery versus treatment as usual i agree that it would be unethical to assign people to surgery who did not want it or forbid those who do wish to get it from getting it that said trans surgery is expensive cost is often a limiting factor for those who otherwise would want to get it i dont see any reason why offering study participants the opportunity to potentially get free trans surgery would be unethical this would limit the study of effects to an inframarginal population namely trans individuals who want to get surgery but seems like it would be a fairly ethical and rigorous method to understand the causal impact of surgery on mental health for a highly policyrelevant subpopulation,1
there is new information though the phenomenon was observed for the first time the confirmation of theory is worth reporting you dont have to think its a big deal but that doesnt mean no one caresi think its a huge deal because there are so many climate deniers this will help people whom are fence sitting to pick a side hopefully the right side,1

the more co2 in the atmosphere the more molecules that can absorb and emit infrared radiation heatat lower altitudes where there is a denser total amount of co2 molecules this means its more likely a photon of infrared radiation will warm the atmospherebut above a certain altitude the free path to space that is the ability of a photon to travel too space without meeting a co2 molecule increases so that most of the photons leave the atmospheremore co2 above this altitude increases the ability of the atmosphere to loose heat its like layers of spheres so the volume increases much quicker than the amount of co2 so the altitude remains sort of the samethis means the upper atmosphere is cooling due to more co2 hot gas expands cool gas contractsthis is why the upper atmosphere is cooling and shrinkingplease note to respondents this is an eli5 its not a graduate level explanation before someone says its more complex than thatampx200bedited this can be a bit tricky so if the op does not understand all of it highlight the bit they do not understand when asking a question about it,1

it definitely chilling and stuck with me even though its been years since i came across it but sadly its consistent with other opinion surveys in academic publications like being shown an image of black man makes many respondents less likely to support housing assistance,1
it seems weird that mental illness would package as neatly along racial divisions as the use of the death penalty would imply,1
the question of ethics for me is within the control group not in the experimental group im all for connecting surgeryready trans folks to more accessible surgery while the evidence is still growing and needs finetuning i find that the weight of the research supporting surgery among those who seek it as a beneficial pathway among those indicated for it far outweighs the evidence to the contrary the control condition would subject people to delays that can impact their transition in irreparable ways including but not limited to delays in transition which can impact how well someone passes the further exacerbation of existing stress and mental health concerns over their current status and more since external factors like harassment and discrimination have currently been identified as major factors in why people detransition i question whether an rct of surgery vs not would really bring new value while remaining ethical its certainly an interesting question though,1

a longitudinal study in the netherlands looking at health outcomes of 3156 trans people between 19722017 noted a higher but decreasing suicide trend among trans people perhaps greater acceptance and better usage of the treatments results in better trans policy this study indicates we are moving in the right direction,1
do we live on the same planet,1
you mean they run the risk of not getting bribes from the oil barons,1
i read the exact same thing xd,1
im more than a decade older and its not the same planet do you remember going for a drive and having to stop at the gas station to wipe all the dead bugs off your windshield yeah not so much these days not even out in the countrysidedo you remember making snow ice cream catching fireflies by the mason jar fulli could go on but you arent the only one whos lived long enough to see the changes,1
not a penny haha,1
of course it is having a conflicting identity with your body is definitely a problem thats why treatments quite extreme ones sometimes are sought,1
it use to be but the laws were changed now ask yourself why this may be the case,1
perhaps transitioning helps trans people live happier healthier lives in a strictly technical sense but with a postsurgery suicide rate 19 times that of the general population based on similarly imperfect data transitioning alone doesnt appear to be the solution to the problems trans people are dealing with,1
i sure hope no one paid much for that study,1
finally sample bias is a valid critique i havent gotten through the whole paper yet so not sure how they address itwould love to hear more on this from anyone who has read that far,1
im in my mid 40s i do not recognize the current weather patterns as the ones from when i was a kid an anecdote does not make a study but there is supposed to be snow on the mountains to the west of me about a month ago its just bare rock,1
its not strictly technical since a multicountry metaanalysis found that quality of life does indeed improve overall recent research also suggests that external factors contribute to worse outcomes among people who transition and coming out and living authentically exposes people to increased levels of victimization i dont think anyone believes transitioning in and of itself is sufficient to reduce things like suicide disparities versus say widespread stigma reduction what i see people most often say is that for surgeryseeking trans people its an important piece of the puzzle,1
yes it has and that took close to zero effort to find please challenge your own assumptions,1
yup if the predictions for large parts of the world being uninhabitable turn out to be true theres going to be a food food shortage and a major refugee crisis after seeing the run on food when covid hit im convinced it would only take another couple weeks of that and total anarchy would ensue were so far removed from getting by on our own that most people will panic people will be killing each other its probably going to be very very bad,1
keep in mind that the issue of being trans and mental health is constantly evolving as society become more accepting of trans youth trans people most likely become more confident and comfortable in their choice a lack of acceptance of trans people even 5 years ago may have contributed to negative mental health outcomes additionally trans research is a nascent field with only around a 20 year robust history that means mistakes may have been made in treatment that medical professionals are learning to avoidthis is great news for everyone but the antitrans community,1
willful ignorance which is a main ingredient of conspiracies has been a growing feature of the gop ever since reagan and trump supercharged it with the willing help of these propaganda sites and we must stop calling them newswith the pandemic it became obvious that willful ignorance is not just an annoyance it is literally deadly,1
i dint understand why there are so many volunteer firefighter jobs shouldnt this be a job that is permanent full time why would anyone do that job without pay,1
some trans people or people defending trans people think its offensive to frame it this way but honestly i have a really hard time conceptualizing trans stuff any other way,1
a couple of things body dysmorphia is not the same as gender dysphoria the latter of which is the diagnosis used for trans people experiencing distress another thing is that being trans itself is not a mental illness gender dysphoria is a disorder that not all trans people have and that people can recover from usually with proper medical and mental health care to help people live in genderaffirming ways,1
throw some thoughts are prayers in the mix,1
sentence not execution,1
im also interested in how this is done,1
so body dismorphia is a mental disorder,1
first off the stat is for death sentences and not executions a death sentence does not have to end in an execution to be considered a death sentence the sentence can be appealed or the convicted could die from other causes the original death sentence would still count in the stats regardless of ultimate outcomewith that said take the years worth of data and combine it with data from other years then check the correlation of death sentences to county courthouse if there is an uneven distribution then you probably have a problem if those courthouses are in areas with greater minority populations then you definitely have a racial problem,1
oh fun i can finally share some of my knowledge about epigenetics here is the eli5 more like eli15 for anyone interestedvirtually every cell inside your body has the same dna eye cells skin cells on you little toe liver cells etc so what makes each cell different a major component of this would be what is called epigenetics there are various molecular factors that influence which proteins get created and which ones dontthe most common epigenetic mechanisms are dna methylation which acts like molecular stop signs for protein synthesis by physically blocking ribosomes from attaching to dna or continuing past a certain point think of it like stoppers on a ball chain that you would find on a ceiling fanhistone modifications which physically changes which parts of the dna are coiled and thus are unable to be read imagine writing an entire book on a thin strip of paper and coiling most of the paper you will only be able to read the part of the book that is uncoiled so depending on where and how much you coil you can get very different messageshowever just about anything that doesnt change the dna itself but rather changes the proteins that are expressed can be considered part of epigenetics conversely what is horrifying about epigenetics is that environmental toxins found in common everyday products and foods plastics pesticides etc can alter epigenetic mechanisms much more rapidly than dna itself potentially leading to detrimental health problems and can still be passed down from generation to generation and to my knowledge there is no way for scientists to slow stop or reverse this epimutation process,1
they were actually making an effort here to isolate the effect of surgery specifically independently of other things that may or may not provide benefitsgtfourth our data set allowed us to control for previous experiences of genderaffirming counseling pubertal suppression and hormone therapy consequently this study is to our knowledge the first largescale investigation to ascertain the mental health benefits of genderaffirming surgeries independent of other common forms of genderaffirming health carepersonally im curious if they controlled in any way for social support and acceptance as ive seen previous studies suggesting that that plays an enormous role in mental health outcomes it seems likely that no one particular thing will bring rates of suicide in line with that of the general population but its nevertheless benficial to know which things contribute,1
removed,1
the thinkers need a better marketing team unfortunately the truth usually isnt very exciting and depressing and mundane enough that people ignore completely,1
gt postsurgery suicide rate 19 times that of the general populationi feel like the near constant lifethreatening harassment and next to zero protections legally from common culture may be responsible for a majority of that,1
considering surveys also have the issue of only getting the attention of those most affected ie people who most dislike a candidate and most like a candidate are most likely to respond to a poll than the larger group of people who dont care so its gunna have a hard time determining how many felt there was no change,1

theres a difference between tech and social media social media is unequivocally damaging as stated within and the damage isnt limited to teens tech playing video games for long hours watching tv for long hours that would make sense for this article,1
the study involved four measures of mental health conduct problems depression emotional problems and suicide there was a decrease in depression associated with both technology and social media to the point that depression currently has no association with either suicide remained flat with social media having a significantly larger association than technology conduct problems remained flat with the association with social media being very slightly higher there was a small increase in emotional problems associated with social media resulting in the social media association becoming equal to the association with tech which had remained flat,1
isnt this contrary to a lot of previously published stuff directly linking social media to declines in mental health ive listened to a few of jonathan haidts seminars and it sounded like that it was pretty conclusive at this point that social media is detrimental to teen mental health,1

ted bundy was an ego maniac and thought he was above the law id bet money it was less suicide by death penalty as another commenter said and a personal challenge that he could get away with itits been a while since i read ann rules book the stranger beside me but iirc he was writing letters to her in his last days and was still pretty convinced hed get out of prisonwouldnt be executed,1
very skeptical of this the study was based on selfreports rightisnt the likelyhood that most have lived with constant internet access the majoritywhole of thier life and are essentially addicted so may either not recognise negative effects or are in denial of them,1
theres that but theres also the fact that by asking for the death penalty they have the ultimate bargaining chip in terms of getting plea deals made it doesnt matter if youre guilty or not if you dont take this plea you will die in prison can you think of a more sadistic but effective bargaining chip,1
abstractgtdigital technology is ubiquitous in modern adolescence and researchers are concerned that it has negative impacts on mental health that furthermore increase over time to investigate whether technology is becoming more harmful we examined changes in associations between technology engagement and mental health in three nationally representative samples results were mixed across types of technology and mental health outcomes technology engagement had become less strongly associated with depression in the past decade but socialmedia use had become more strongly associated with emotional problems we detected no changes in five other associations or differential associations by sex there is therefore little evidence for increases in the associations between adolescents technology engagement and mental health information about new digital media has been collected for a relatively short time drawing firm conclusions about changes in their associations with mental health may be premature we urge transparent and credible collaborations between scientists and technology companieslink,1

ops title is misleading the article reports that the known negative effects have not worsened over time not that they dont exist from the actual study there is no evidence that associations between adolescents digital technology engagement and mental health problems have increased,1
1 the article does say that social media use has become more strongly associated with emotional problems though the size of the effect is pretty small2 social media is not unequivocally damaging its damaging for some people using it in certain ways at certain times it does not have a monolithic effect on everybody and pretending that it does is silly as with all tech social media comes with its own set of advantages connecting to friends watching funny videos looking for support and disadvantages misinformation chasing ideal beauty uncivilized dialogue etc we should not pretend that social media is some silver bullet that if it were taken away everything would magically be better,1

its crazy how asking about funding is considered a negative you should always be looking at the funding source when evaluating scientific literature its just good practice,1
a number of years ago when social media use became widespread i heard an interview with an expert on teen mental health wish i could remember her nameit might have been the one who wrote queen bees she said that social media just documented the drama and bullying that had always happened offscreen social media wasnt allowing a whole new phenomenon but it was showing adults what was going on in an undeniable way if mean destructive or disturbing words were said and the teen told parents about it parents could dismiss it by saying that there was a misunderstanding a joke or that it must have come out wrong but with written words in context it was impossible to ignore a popular girl telling a less popular girl that she should kill herself etc,1
i have a hard time believing this and i have no data to back up my disbelief i find it hard to believe that technology—and social media in particular—hasnt made a significantly negative impact on our lives and mental wellbeing with the last couple of generations practically being raised with technology that is increasingly designed to target and manipulate people at all stages of life i dont see how there isnt some sort of negative impact,1

where does pm25 come fromthere are outdoor and indoor sources of fine particles outside fine particles primarily come from car truck bus and offroad vehicle eg construction equipment snowmobile locomotive exhausts other operations that involve the burning of fuels such as wood heating oil or coal and natural sources such as forest and grass fires fine particles also form from the reaction of gases or droplets in the atmosphere from sources such as power plants these chemical reactions can occur miles from the original source of the emissions in new york state some of the fine particles measured in the air are carried by wind from outofstate sources because fine particles can be carried long distances from their source events such as wildfires or volcanic eruptions can raise fine particle concentrations hundreds of miles from the eventpm25 is also produced by common indoor activities some indoor sources of fine particles are tobacco smoke cooking eg frying sautéing and broiling burning candles or oil lamps and operating fireplaces and fuelburning space heaters eg kerosene heaters source,1

burning natural gas and wood instead of coal was supposed to be a bridge to a safer future where heat and electricity came from sources that didnt generate as much pollutionbut new research suggests the alternative fuels are less of a bridge and more of a staircase a new harvard university study found that in at least 19 states plus washington dc burning gas now kills more people than coal because of exposure to a deadly type of fine particulate matter known as pm25 that lingers in the air and lodges in lung tissuethe study published wednesday in the journal environmental research letters found 47000 to 69000 premature deaths each year that could be attributed to emissions from things like buildings power generators and industrial boilers of that fumes from gas wood and biomass were responsible for between 29000 and 46000 deathsif you swap out one combustion fuel for another thats not a pathway toward a healthy energy system said harvard research scientist jonathan buonocore papers lead author this is showing that even with the transition from coal to gas there are remaining impactsthe findings do highlight the benefits of eliminating coal in 2008 when coal produced nearly half the nations electricity emissions from the power sector caused between 59000 and 66000 premature deaths by 2017 that fell to 10000 to 12000 deaths,1
gtif you swap out one combustion fuel for another thats not a pathway toward a healthy energy systemisnt the healthy energy system were looking for more oriented towards alleviating climate change rather than direct deaths do these premature deaths in the study account for deaths resulting from climate change due to emissions,1
limestone doesnt contain silicates and the reaction is as followscaco3 heat cao co2it produces lime,1
indeed if youre strict about it most of the things we measure are actually calculations deriving from a very basic measurementthe only things you can really measure are counts and whether something is the same or not for instance when you measure a length you count the number of centimeters or whatever on your ruler while you make sure the ruler is properly aligned the ends meet in the same location with the thing you are trying to measure time is measured by counting the number of caesium decays and so forth,1
thats because to make cement you generally take limestone caco3 and turn it into cao by stripping off co2 for every ton of cement produced you have approximately a ton of co2 left over plus the energy required for this process and the energy required to move the stuff around limestone contains a tremendous amount of sequestered atmospheric co2 from a very long time ago far more than hydrocarbons,1

sadly it doesgt the continued and extended use of nuclear power is often considered and discussed as a viable energy policy option to meet energy demands while also meeting national co2 emission reduction goals a central issue in energy policy for sustainability is the question of nuclear reactor safety however studies on nuclear reactor safety often run up against the problem of estimating the probability of a major accident from patchy and limited empirical data gt gthere we describe a simple probabilistic model of catastrophic nuclear reactor accidents based on a set of four assumptions the model treats the accident probability in each of reactors as a variable and returns the probability of a major accident in the reactor fleet we find that at 995 reactor safety the probability of another chernobyl or fukushimasized event is 49 for the global fleet and that safety would have to be 9996 in order to bring that probability below 5 we discuss our findings in light of the debate on energy policy for sustainability gt by our calculations the overall probability of a coremelt accident in the next decade in a world with 443 reactors is almost 70 because of statistical uncertainty however the probability could range from about 28 to roughly 95 the united states with 104 reactors has about a 50 probability of experiencing one coremelt accident within the next 25 years sure reasonable people can argue that the risks of abandoning nuclear power are worse but one should not pretend these risks do not exist in the first place,1

a psychoplastogen is any chemical which promotes neural plasticity for a few days after ingestion many psycacelics like dmt lsd and psilocybin promote neurogenesis the formation of new brain cells while the mechanisms are not currently fully understood its been observed that during this period of neurogenesis patients are able to effectively rewrite negative associations theyve carried with them for a long while as well as form new ones basically the dosing of a psychoplastogen in combination with talk therapy can help someone make astoundingly rapid progress in dealing with trauma and depression potentially this period of exceptional neuroplasticity can work in the opposite way too creating new traumatic connections from a negative experience during a trip that is presumably why a firsttime or inexperienced psycacelic user may develop an anxiety related to psycadelics after a bad trip but more experienced users may find that most bad trips are simply challenging and coming through it can lead to very healing revelations what researchers are now experimenting with are ways to induce this state of increased neurogenesis and neuroplasticity while avoiding the psycadelic trip aspect of the drugs,1

only 45 to 90 is a lot the researchers think so too from the titleface masks considerably reduce covid19 cases in germany,1
michigan is not very compliant its government has been pretty procompliance in its policies but actual compliance seems to be lagging especially in rural areas which is much of the state and outright defiance like restaurants advertising that they will be open with no safeguards or large private gatherings seems to be high,1

this assumes that if a state mandates mask wearing there is 100 compliance or if a state doesnt mandate masking then 100 of people dont wear a mask its entirely possible that despite the differences in official approaches that older floridians of which there are quite a lot voluntarily wore masks socially distanced etc because of their age which muted floridas numbers similarly californians who are younger or who live in multifamily housing could have disregarded the mandates or they could have been impossible to follow due to density all this to say i think its really hard to point to a states official approach and compare results given how easy it was for individuals to disregard those mandates at any time,1

the question is do you get paid the same for the same amount of work,1
not the guy above you but in novel mass infections like this pandemic delaying deaths is saving lives since you start out not knowing how to treat having no drugs or proven methods for saving lives but as the pandemic goes on and drugstreatments are discovered the odds of dying goes down delaying death saves lives not all of them obviously but a considerable number,1

my neighbors have family in a smaller city in midmi and from what ive heard covid just isnt a thing that they think or care about in their daily lives other than something that causes government annoyances they try to avoid they and all their friends basically go to work restaurants and each others houses as normal despite the mask and business closure mandates other than throwing on a mask for a few seconds for restaurants that firmly require them however thats just an anectdote to be fair theyve been like that for more than a year without issue and the current outbreak is hitting both both deeply urban and rural areas pretty evenly so theres clearly some other reason michigan is getting uniquely clobbered right now,1

does it save lives or delay deaths ive been trying to figure out what the hell is going on in michigan right now and to the best of my research all i can find from news articles is they had really great adherence to protocols people started getting the vaccine and getting lockdown fatigue and got the uk variant at the same time so even though florida and michigan both have the uk variant florida is doing better because more people were exposed earlier due to their lack of masks they took the hit with the lesser powerful covid strain i think a lot of these studies are looking backwards trying to infer future performance or say to do things in the future but arent taking into account human behavior and its going to end badly for a lot of people,1
i think you misunderstand the science a bit reflection definately can help global climate we can see this is studies that look at snow cover for instance which reflecta much more light than the ground or ocean that may he underneathwhile the greenhouse effect definately does still trap some of the reflectes light its not 100 if it was 100 we would all be dead rather it is just some proportion so reflecting more light means more enery will go back into space reflecting light is always going to be more efficient climate wise than having the earth just absorb that lightfinally rooftops there is upwards of 25 billion sq m of roofs in the us with about 20 of that in cities that is 2x the size of the entire state road island even if you have a percentage of those it can certainly have big effectsas far as producing enough paint industrial manufacturing plants probably produce way more paint than you think they do,1

because people have been misled to believe that the common cold is the flu,1
influenza is a terrible disease why do we keep referring to it like its the sniffles,1
gtin two studies which included 913 individuals in total participants were asked to read an article in which a scientist was quoted as debunking a popular misconception this is an awful title they werent testing peoples reaction to empirical evidence they were testing reactions to authority figures a scientist is not the same as science gtwe asked participants to rate the legitimacy of researchers and people providing anecdotal evidence for topics like whether luck exists in games of chance whether a personality test is accurate whether fund managers can beat the market — topics that arent politicized but also where the science is pretty clear and for luck its by definition,1
this it was not until i really had the flu did i realize how much worse the flu is vs a cold common to see coldflu medicine so most think they are about the same they are not,1
absolutely ive only ever had the flu once and the way you can differentiate is if you would rather be dead than keep feeling like that the worst part for me is the aches its like muscles you didnt know you had are in intolerable pain,1

removed,1
but its also worth noting that people can and do have mild cases of influenza and while influenza is more serious than the common cold its definitely possible to have influenza without feeling intolerable pain or like youd rather be dead in some cases someone may have the flu but mistake it for the common cold due to their symptoms npr published an article on this here,1

the problem with this study is that theyre comparing people who were hospitalized for the two diseases but most people who get either disease are not hospitalizedin fact the number of deaths from covid19 among children is much lower than the usual number of flu deaths per year among children its much higher for adultsso the statement that mortality was ten times higher in children aged 1117 with covid19 is highly misleading since it is only looking at in hospital mortality not mortality over all only a tiny percentage of children with covid19 end up being hospitalized,1

yes and the same with covid lots of overlap in symptoms plus some people just dont get hit as hard so they go around speaking like it was nothing tell that to the thousands that have died or the tens of thousands that have spent literal months in the hospital on a ventilator and they are just the 20 that actually came off the ventilator the other 80 didnt make itthe difference is covid infects the mucus membranes lining the lungs and sinuses and it can get so bad that a few people even had to have lung transplants because it wrecked theirs also the damage done to the lungs even in a person with mild symptoms can cause adverse effects 8 months after recovering from the disease covid carries with it the potential to cause long term respiratory damage and issues even in mild cases,1

mortality wise weve seen rates drop due to a variety of reasons better therapeutics less overwhelmed hospitals but also more young people getting infected yet is not particularly clear if this is a change that will sustain especially now that hospitals at least in the some areas are filling up again however this is clearly more contagious than influenza even more so the new strains which is why influenza has been very low this year with vaccinations and natural immunity for covid the rate of severe infection should decrease and like influenza we will likely see years were its worse than others,1

well that and the massive economic post war boom which i dont attribute fully to not needing to rebuild we didnt have that much built before ww2 dear sirmadam but afterwards oh boy the highways and the infrastructure no the issue iswas the slow decline of public spending and an obsession republicans started making of paying fewer taxes decades of fiscal stupidity lead here not us being ahead infrastructure wise we lost a good many of our boys in the war but the ones that came back came back to opportunity unfortunate their children decided that wasnt something they wanted for their children and here we are,1

youre totally ignoring other problems from getting covid19 because youre only looking at deaths even though around 40 of covid deaths in the us were from people below the age of 80 hospitals especially rural ones are being overrun by covid19 patients meaning that many are not getting the proper caremany people who have gotten covid19 but survived have severe health problems with the lungs and nervous system and many now have a shortened lifespan because of itthere is pros and cons with everything nothing will be 100 for society but you have to weigh the pros and cons it is terrible that abuse has increased but dont act like that would have been completely solved if there was no lockdowns the system to protect victims was already failing before covid19,1

incomplete argument carbon absorption vs carbon sink temperate forests soils are more the carbon sink than the actual biomass as long as you are replanting these forests wood is a highly renewable resource we should be using more most forest clearing the destructive kind is when we clear forest for animal feed has very little to do with timber production which is negligible amount of forest clearing,1

fully understood my argument is with the tenuous connection with economic stress over the basic physicality of increased confinement for long periods of time ie abuse is likely up simply due to the lockdown confinement alone rather than the result of financial changes the article it says states the tenuous uncertainty multiple timesgtviolence might increase because of the economic crisis but also because of the lockdownandgt the results do not necessarily show a causal relationship between economic or lockdownrelated stress and intimate partner violencethe fact this study was conducted by economists at a economic university further skews results interpretation its logical that an economist at the university of economics would want to see a finance based result or outcome of the study rather than having a holistically objective investigation and drawing data based conclusions from therea much better study wouldve been too similar groups from matching socio economic backgrounds but one with the 80 furlough and one with a 40 furlough scheme then maybe greater financial and economic impact could be extracted from the data so far what ive seen here looks very superficial,1

thats truebut there are also ways to collude on pricing and act like a cartel without actually speaking to each other its called commercial signaling and its a dark art in this case its a pretty simple mechanism one company raises prices on getting fda approval and waits to see if the others follow suit if they do the price rise sticks and they all make more money if not then they just roll it back but the price rises stick here because there are not enough bulk buyers with leverage in the market there ought to be medicare pays for enough drugs but there isnt because republicans,1
you started to go in a direction there at the end that is equally important it isnt just a provider drug company problem but also a payer health insurance company problem the opaque web of list prices discounts and other dark magic make it nearly impossible for consumers to get any kind of straightforward or fair pricesa perfect example of this game in action is the recent introductions of generic insulin analogs until last year when insulin was finally categorized as a biologic rather than a drug manufacturers couldnt get generic versions of their newest insulin analogs novolog humalog etc approved by the fda the drug rules wouldve required them to start from scratch rather than piggybacking off the approval process for their completely identical brand name products which would have been way too expensiveso now instead of extremely expensive humalog or novolog we have moderately expensive half cost insulin lispro and insulin aspart exact same stuff slightly different labeling totally different price structure and yet i would still call this a great achievement thats how messed up the pricing system is,1

in our system insulin is very nearly the ideal drug for the pharmaceutical companies insulindependent diabetics need to take it every day perhaps several times a die for as long as they live if they dont take it theyll die eventually and quite uncomfortably the drug companies could hardly have created a medication more suited to their greed i am sure theyve done the calculus to determine how much they can actually charge before people begin going without and the companies lose their client base am i cynical yes and after working in health care for 40 years i think im allowed to be such our health care industry is built on ruthless exploitation for profit from top to bottom and big pharma is the most mercenary im also very skeptical of any talk of reform because so much money is involved and so many people would stand to lose their very large shares of the pie if it were more equitable,1

it did in january i paid 35 a month for the 2 types of insulin i use so a 90 day supply of both ran me 210 and did not count against my medicare limits so it would not run me into the donut hole like insulin did me last year i am due to renew to the tune of 735 each for 90 days or 1470 ive been holding off hoping the freeze will be lifted before i have to get some but its not looking good its not just insulin epipens and a few other drugs were also included in the lower price medicines and all are frozen,1

people overestimate the effectiveness of competition in our society we tend to have a very specific idea of what competition is and how it operates but it doesnt apply that way to our society with its megacorps that have a stranglehold on industries often multiple at a time they can simply buy up a competitor or throw money to bury competitors instead of improving their product or lowering pricesadd the broken medical system and the necessity of the drug on top of the usual corporate bs and you have something that is unsurprisingly destructive the price of entry is high and the profits get pushed ever higher,1

gt does that fall on each individual person to maintain skills relevant to gainful employmenti would argue that the burden put on the individual to maintain skills has been increasing in western society for decades and it has had an effect of harming the family uniti have lots of extended family good old conservative blue collar rural folks who dont have the intellectual curiosity or ability to code they want to put in their 8 hours at some job help each other pick up their kids and shuttle nieces and nephews to practices cook dinner for family toss the ball with their kid do some chores around the house maybe play a game of cards after dinner and drink a beer as the sun goes downthe extreme push towards maintaining a relevant resume and career has utterly destroyed any incentive for this lifestyle we now have to spend nearly every hour not working being productive in anticipation of needing new skills when we get laid off it means everyone is too busy to see family to organize a picnic to play a guitar to take a vacation to live life the extended family i described will never not even under threat of starvation and homelessness live a life where they rush home from work and start exercises in a code academy they will never have the global context to know which industries are rising and falling and what a good company to hitch on to will be a philosophy of its your responsibility to maintain skills essentially sentences these people to a live of poverty and all the pain that comes with itironically the extended family i describe generally vote for procapitalist candidates that exacerbate the automation policies that threatens their lifestyle and they vote for those candidates on the basis that their traditional rural blue collar lifestyle should be protected this is an inconsistency that has baffled me my whole lifeif we care for that lifestyle in the slightest we should acknowledge that capitalism and automation guarantee that it will need to be subsidized to some degree that we need to ease off the gas when it comes to the free market that if jobs get automated we should be collectively be lowering work hours if we get the same output of resources this would salvage the sort of lifestyle we say we likeif people genuinely think that the market should determine our lifestyles rather than the other way around and a life where we all live in privatized single bed pods with anxious hearts trying to dance for corporate masters and compete for food based on how much of our waking time were willing to give for the profit motive at the very least say that i think its manipulation of the highest order to purport that you want to maintain simple traditional living and take economic steps to utterly destroy it,1

fred is a great site my starting point for economic data as general matteri dont think 04 trillion added to the deficit precovid is remotely insignificant and that was happening at period when the exact opposite should be happening deficit spending during a strong economy is going to put you in a bad position as you move to the recession side of the economic cycle or worse hit a crisis like covid if you look at obamas 8yrs there was 109 trillion of debt added per year but obviously much of that was a result of the great recession if you look at obamas 2nd term that figure is 077 trillion per year for trump even if exclude covid and just look at his first three years that figure is 113 trillion gtthe debt trend really didnt change much until covid and actually reduce substantial at one pointas you can see from link above there was no substantial reduction in us federal debt but the point is that the debt trend should have changed under trump debt is a balance if you want to look at the tend you should look at deficits and the trend was clear adding gt1tn per year in a strong economy late in the cycle is insane imhomanufacturing had a bump up in 2018 but wasnt a sustainable thing and was already falling off in 2019 before covid hit see similar trend in manufacturing employment data and not really sure how claim shored up manufacturing sector when our trade balance on goods continued to worse under trump,1

i think we americans didnt have any sort of unified plan or playbook to go off of for such a sudden shift to distance learning like you said online schools have better models and methods of teaching but what we had was something that was pieced together last minute out of necessity then you add in the fact that no one knew how long the pandemic would last and that school districts or states were all doing different things and you get the largely ineffective year of zoom we had the future studies that come out on education in 2020 and its effect on students are going to be fascinating,1

yes 1 for oceanbased solutions just fyi most of the carbon that makes its way to the deep ocean isnt sunken plankton the plankton is consumed or matures in the higher epipelagicmesopelagic zones where light reaches and most ocean trophic activity occurs but eventually the carbon reaches the deep ocean through marine snow food falls or megafaunas role in the oceanic carbon pump,1

there is a huge difference between closing your border when living on an isolated island and when you share a land border with other countries nz has been able to keep importing and exporting products without too many additional restrictions since time shipping here effectively acts as a quarantine for people on the boat that alone massively reduces the logistics of the quarantine compare that to say france where most imports arrive either on the back of a truck train or shipping that takes a day or so if that how can you 100 quarantine if you have hundreds thousands of truck drivers crossing the border every day who all need to eatsleepget fueletc weve done well here but our isolation is probably the key reason for that successthe key is that nz had light at the end of the tunnel we could all see that once we got rid of covid we wouldshould be able to keep it out that made people willing to accept a very strick but short term lockdown but if you dont have that light then a massive strick lockdown isnt going to get you anywhere if you cant keep it out indefinitely like we theoretically can then there is no point,1

as i understand it because quantum info changes whenever its observed youll be able to tell if someones peeped at your transmission or not when you exchange crypto keys if yes throw it out and redo the key exchange if not then your transmission is securenothing moves faster or instantly transmits or really anything of that sortthat sound about right,1
vulnerable people are his fan base,1
he was pushing vaccines that hadnt been tested yethow is that the same thing whatre you talking about,1
so according to the article you linked astra zenica was going to have 300 million doses ready for americans by october 2020 perhaps they meant 2021 i dont know but go ahead and give trump all the credit for that,1
i mean flat earthers are even lower hanging fruit we knew the earth was round thousands of years ago and there are some very easy ways to prove it but still they hold on to their truth,1
the persona spouting innacurate information accusing everyone of being a child is asking that others grow up child you are too hilarious i hope this all doesnt make you cringe too much when you grow up,1
yes too many people took this study and ran with it the wrong way whats interesting to me was the valved n95 that was as good as or better than the cloth masks the volume of ten 10 um diameter particles doesnt equal the volume of one 100 um particle,1
i explained this to an antimask friend it managed to change his mind for a couple of days but after that he went right back to arguing his previous points of misinformation such as the virus particle size i gave up trying to convince him after that,1
you sound like a child who doesnt realize theyre a child,1
ripples in space travel at c,1
the funniest thing was when they did experiments themselves that showed the curvature of the earth,1
thats the whole point its something the flat landers cant even really comprehend,1
i dunno man a war got bush reelected as it did for nixon and fdr,1
also an interesting side effect of this virus is that it has miraculously given everyone graduate degrees in virology and immunology that entitles them to have opinions on the direction of public health it has been a very long pandemic,1
the study should have been caught at peer review i remember seeing this when the authors posted it on twitter i held my tongue but not a great paper at what it was trying to do much less the implications that it produced,1
gt no you cant use the entangled particles to transmit informationpointlessly nitpicky but to be clear of course you can use entangled particles to transmit information in exactly the same way any other particle can while respecting the speed of light you just cant act on distant entangled pairs to transmit information ftl to the other side,1
if you put a brick in your car and drive into a coffee cup does it still make a sound,1
im not saying all vulnerable people support trump im saying all trump supporters are mentally fragile,1
ive experienced this before they basically just capitulate in the moment if they dont have any kind of retort and like you said just keep on keeping on,1
my understanding is that the question of antimatters interaction with gravity is still unknown and that there is active research on this at cern with the aegis experiment,1
operation warp speed was to increase speed production not creating the vaccine the first vaccine where from the eu and then produced in the us for the us population,1
ah yes ignoring facts is very objective,1
hes not too wrong anyone who steadfastly believes in string theory is doing so in faith rather than empiricism string theory intentionally seeks to replicate the existing observations without making any new falsifiable assertions which makes it an interpretation rather than a theory much like everetts many worlds in quantumdid any of them predict the particular new lepton physics weve encountered in the b decays and muon dipole,1
where do you think the energy you are using now ultimately comes from,1
reading this made me realise how stupid i am,1
gtin largely atheistic china people who are religious report higher levels of life satisfaction compared to people with no religious beliefs — an association that has the biggest effect among disadvantaged groups according to new researchfirstly the headline is misleading self reports of subjective feelings are not equal to wellbeing anorexic people would report higher levels of satisfaction if they are skinnier doesnt equate to wellbeingsecondly it just means those without a fairy tale see the grim reality of their circumstances much more clearly slaves are happier if you give them drugs too,1
yes dummy its been known that covid is far more contagious than the flu and other respiratory illnesses also ever heard of holidays,1
im constantly facepalming at how many people view the world in black and white like thisits pretty obvious that wearing a mask will provide a degree of protection over nothing people really need multiple studies to decide whether that degree of efficacy is worth dying over,1
they should do the same for dirt on earth,1
the study you are referring to had no intention of determining efficacy of any mask they tested the sole purpose of the study was to develop and prove out an insanely cheap method for counting particles basically using an iphone they vastly overstepped their competencies and claimed efficacy of the masks tested the methods they used were vastly inadequate to make any determinations,1
except youre ignoring the concept of friction loss the loss of fluid velocity is proportional to the length of time it travels through a high friction environment even high friction materials like filters will only add a very small amount of friction when the distance traveled is very small for examples a typical mask is about 05mm lets say your hose is about a meter if the crosssectional area of the flow is the same and both are filled with cotton so the loss in energy over a given distance is the same the pipe would have 2000x the resistance if the mask which would make the level of effort analogous to the difference between lifting a can of beans and a literal ton your analogy does not make sense and is deeply flawed,1
being an idiot is a disability,1
that was the assumption but it has been disproven many times what they were actually seeing were fabric particles from the mask according to another university that reran the study,1
yeah i had people texting me the paper thinking it would sway my opinion they insted got to learn how complex filtration is the idea would have been there if they had just integrated for volume of ejected particles i dont recall if that was possible with their setup its been a minute since i read it,1
its been admitted by the cdc that they made a bad call and lied to avoid a mask shortage for hospitals like what happened in other nationsthe damage from that was catastrophic and i hope they learned their lesson thousands no longer have that opportunity to be clear i am procdc and on that note lets not pretend the cdc is infalliable but its definitely running better under an administration that cares about keeping people well over election victories,1
gaiter,1
what argument i did math you said nonsense no argument here youre just wrong and youre welcome for pointing that out so you could learnand then a few minutes later you wrote another comment your word doesnt mean a lot does itjust pause for a minute and learn its not that hard,1
the headline overstates things its possibly a way to treat perchlorateladen soil on mars but untested it also doesnt remove all obstacles to farming,1
removed,1
covid is more transmissible than the flu,1
it also matters where you buy them from i was ordering directly from korea once international shipping was straightened out and the difference in quality was apparent either way the market was flooded with fake product and profiteering,1
yeah i was confused about expired airborne particles talking and coughingfor a little bit at least,1
wow i thought theyd already done this maybe i misread an article from when they started building planning funding the aegis experiment the article talks about the importance of knowing exactly when the antihydrogen atoms are made presumably to make it easier to pinpoint the exact location to track its position in my naive view of things they could just make a really big magnetic confinement vacuum chamber hold the clump of antihydrogen at the middle cut the magnetic field and watch which way the cloud goes hopefully therell be time for it to move up or down before it spreads out sideways enough to touch the walls i guess its not that easy you cant exact phone iter and ask to put a bunch of antimatter in their obscenely expensive unfinished magnet chamber,1
thats a good one,1
the one from feb 5th 2020,1
luckily a lot of them have been convinced voting isnt 100 effective so theyre giving up on that as well its a fair tradeoff,1
he isnt but he likes to cast doubt he has done it on camera about childhood vaccinationbut does fuel the conspiracy he was anti mask its a nebulous communitybut he was very well placed to shoot down antivaccine community but he wont,1
removed,1
we learned nothing new about covid after february 2020,1
you are so stunning and brave,1
its a little over my head but i believe this means you can turn into your own evil twin,1
for that to be true the mask would have to draw virus particles into your airways like a tractor beam this seems improbable it cant increase risk compared to no mask there are no plausible mechanisms for that,1
i go with seatbelts because clearly these morons are reproducing,1
thanks for the check one of the few legit people on reddit,1
ah did not know thatagain why increase speed of production if he is going on to social media to tell people not to get it wouldnt he want to hamstring production if he was antivax,1
wait a minute trump and wife were vaccinated,1
its almost like they were used for that specific purpose by healthcare workers all along even before the pandemic wow crazy,1
like me not grabbing the weird looking apple at the supermarket,1
i cant even begin to imagine what a 4d shape would look like,1
the title should be ‘ face masks are effective in blocking airborne particles expired from talking and coughing even if they dont seal around the edges phrased as it is in the title implies that facemasks stop the particles from talking and coughing sorry but the grammar nazi in me had to,1
so the first one approved in the us was from germany and how any of that making the us the creator of the vaccine,1
general horribleness and incompetence sums it up perfectly,1
dude he said that in feb 2020 it wasnt even called a pandemic at that point imagine changing your mind as new information came up like asymptomatic transmission a higher rate of airborne spread than initially expected and supply chains catching up to demandwe didnt know much about the virus then we now know more he changed his mind hes a scientist thats what theyre supposed to do in the face of new information,1
wrong sub to spread your bs,1
masks social distancing a one month hard lockdown and a national contact tracing system is all you guys needed to get the virus under control sad that is was too much of an ask for too many people,1
his account suspension literally saved lives,1
100 recommend this book ive been waiting for like a month for a copy to be available at my library and it just procced today,1
unequal sizes is the nature of this type of analysis though and from the study the absence of events among those who were previously infected whether they received the vaccine or not precluded accurate or precise estimates for the latter effect size thats like a divide by zero error i dont think the study is claiming anything controversial people with a previous infection and the requisite immune response seem to be protected,1
politics aside i didnt even get a cold last year frankly i am going to keep wearing mask where it is reasonable,1
but if you do a bunch of antimatter experiments in there itll probably break the magnets and stop them doing fusion experiments maybe they should wait until iter gets replaced and buy the old iter magnets second hand one careful owner may be slightly radioactive,1
yeah hes an idiot what else did people expect when they elected a nyc con artist to be their president,1
items of both the highest and lowest quality are made in china you cant accurately make a blanket statement like chinese goods are,1
trump orders his supporters to attack fauci and you all do what youre told like good little followers dont ever question trumps word,1
yeah i mean i guess i get why they did it but if lying to the public always seems like a bad idea because then how do you know if they are lying the next time,1
i tried maintaining a hotswap but an infinitesimal moment later it blew up into a big hot mess of quarks and leptons,1
at the start of this all i was really hoping this would make masks a norm and wed see more use during like flu season etc it makes sense to wear them if youre feeling sicki no longer have that hope,1
i still want to know how we intend to get any kind of heavy machinery amp materials to mars we can construct a space station in orbit made up of relatively light modules that dont need to withstand gravity and surface conditions big enough for only a few people in cramped conditionsthat just seems a very long way from somehow constructing robust living and working domes or whatever on mars big enough for the activities we want to do there,1
please show the study then ill read itbut note there has never been a mask mandate in america so there is thati live in japan the government is doing a piss poor job at the vaccine rollout but everyone wears masks and japan has about 19th the per capita deaths of america japan has far fewer icus per capita than almost every nation on earth as well vietnam thailand korea everyone wears masks and they didnt get hit,1
great courses on audible lost worlds of south america they mention a supposed incan outpost near marajo island on the mouth of the amazon thats on the atlantic,1
nailed it mate spot on,1
the uk is even further from herd immunity than the us is cases are literally going up in the uk right now theyre 3x higher than they were a couple weeks ago i dont think you know what herd immunity is,1
ive searched for it numerous times im not aware of any studies that exist that experiment with the actual virus if you could link just one it would help,1
in australia it was a bit different the tools and techniques may have been primitive but the result and motive are the sameaboriginals created bushfires to hunt basically burn a massive section of bush and walk through after picking up the dead remainsthis of cause killed way more animals then they needed and species they had no reason to killmass destruction for short term gain this permanently changed australias ecosystem and even climatemany areas of big empty grasslands which are now arid used to be rainforrests by burning them down weather cycles were alteredin addition to the changes in climate it also wiped out entire genomes of mega fauna australia used to have wombats as big as bears big apex predators etc very similar to african megafauna not to mention all the small species like bush mice possums and reptileswhether it was a chainsaw or a torch humans are marvellously short sighted,1
of course it does you are being forced to wear it same with conscription taxes hate speech regulation mandatory schooling for children and rules of the road that you have to follow just because you agree to follow them doesnt mean that these regulations and thats what they are dont restrict your freedoms thing is thats something societies actually do and have to do for the benefit of being societies thats why mandatory vaccination is a good idea and why sensible and generally more free than the us nations will sooner or later implement it for covid us probably wont you are right about that,1

gtwas responsible for the vaccinethe vaccines were going to come into existence whether trump was in office or notthe potus doesnt rule the planet,1
he got a medically necessary cocktail of experimental drugs only reserved for the most privileged of people while on his deathbed when did he get the vaccine,1
its a wellknown fact that octopuses have eight arms but did you know that each arm contains its own mini brain,1
its called the backfire effect people caring certain beliefs closer to their personal identities and research shows that when given facts counter to their belief their convictions get stronger in that belief there is a really interesting podcast series on this phenomenon you are not so smart has a 4 part series on the backfire effect its worth a listen,1
i think the key is in 2020antivax has had a huge root in social media before trump in 2020 i know we like to hate trump on reddit and he was the most high profile pusher in 2020 probably ever but social media has allowed the existence of antivax since they were invented in 2019 there was an outbreak of measles in portland due to antivax,1
your recollection is fuzzed harriss statement was that she would trust researchers when they said a vaccine was ready and would not take trumps word if he said something was ready but the researchers didnt agree,1
responsible my ass,1
i stopped eating them and dolphin,1
except he did all the senate and house republicans got it too,1
he was not responsible for the vaccine also the vaccine is many vaccinesalso i said set everything else aside and think about how a guy is a node in the antivax movement study says so while being someone who in secret took the vaccinethats a 2 faced person,1
was about to post that in my humble opinion they could take over the planet if humanity offs itself,1
it doesnt really seem relevant that a small chunk of the research for the vaccines occurred under the trump administration how would that change whether or not anti vaxxers gravitate around trump onlineit of course makes sense considering trump focused much of his pandemic response to downplaying the pandemic while discouraging efforts to do anything about it gtits been 6 monthscorrect it hasnt even been a year since trump has left office and hes still a major thought leader in the republican party its been years since hillary clinton has ever held any office and she still gets brought up by republicans 6 months after trump took office his supporters were chanting about locking clinton obama and others up,1
my octopus teacher is a great documentary i caught it on netflix,1
the moment i watched the documentary on netflix and found out how social octopuses were i stopped eating them as well,1
rent free youre the one in a cult,1
thats not true at all mrna vaccines by nature and function can only survive in the cytoplasm of the cell for 24 weeks after which the protein mechanisms literally die out this means any long term health issues of which there are very very very very very few are known 46 weeks after your shots meaning if these vaccines were even remotely dangerous on a large scale we wouldve known about it when all those vaccinated people started dropping dead back in february which as you know they didnt they work theyre safe theyre widely available theres no longer any good reasons to not get one outside of a medical condition,1
not the only type bay area bourgeoisie areas had plenty of antivax moms who felt the knew more than the doctors i dont know how it split but im confident theres these morons on both sides,1
it is a difference between a politician answer and a professional answer would she trust a person who said to inject bleach in their body or would she trust a medical professional with years of training and experience we should be inspired by our leaders and have a level of trust in them but the last few years have been more difficult to do so,1
this one actually wants to hes that fucked up,1
just imagine what might happen if the presidents twitter is disabled and the us gets attacked how will he send orders to the generals without tweeting at them,1
removed,1
removed,1
ok benghazi,1
sounds like correlation with an assumption of causation,1
nudibranchs,1
technically i think it was injecting bleach,1
my point is that your statement is an antivax talking point thats not based on reality vaccines have been falsely blamed for a number of illnesses that occured months or years after they were given but as far as i know none of those claims were ever validated by empirical evidence but the claim that vaccines could show up as problematic much later persists,1
yeah if hes going to just take credit for everything that happened during his 4 years he should also get credit for the virus existing at all,1
i believe its missing a word in the 1st sentence it should be quantum secured communication rather than quantum communication there they correctextend the information in the 2nd sentence,1
youre not wrong about small aspects individual facts but youve ignored larger context you also seem to think nothing could have been done about the 500k deaths they did their best downplaying the astronomical failure frankly makes you a dangerous individual also youve not once given credence to the numerous contributing factors that trump personally had a hand in which makes you sound like a political zealot,1
well known fact that octopi were on the meteor that crashed into earth long time ago,1
i was going to post about octopi but checked myself and octopus is a greek word so the latin plural doesnt apply,1
not technologically competent otherwise they would have already dealt with human pollutants,1
gtas i understand it because quantum info changes whenever its observed youll be able to tell if someones peeped at your transmission or not when you exchange crypto keys right and i believe the key point is that such a discovery first requires both sides to compare notes over a traditional information channelneither end can detect tampering on its own because you cant observepeep without causing changes of your own,1
is there an example of a modern vaccine that has long term adverse effects,1
i agree science requires openness and debate and willingness to change the esablished orthodoxy based on demonstrated dissent this requires open dissent to be possible banning and especially shadowbanning prevent thiswill also be used for reasons outside the intended spirit,1
but would they,1

im sorry what does a billionaire donating a miniscule proportion of his wealth have to do with him being an asshole just because he was free doesnt mean america shouldnt have hired someone worth the money,1

im prepared to agree with you but looking at the replies you seem to always include personal attacks andor insults so i guess that makes you the least mature person here,1
he was pushing hydroxy chloroquine,1
this guy gets itim convinced that when humans are no longer top dog it will be octopuses and squid that replace us its only a matter of time,1
yeah its just that 2020 has pushed antivaxx big into the mainstream well see if it goes back down as we get further away from 2020,1
the cdc continues to monitor all the vaccines it approved that doesnt imply a long term adverse outcome is more likely from the covid vaccines that have been through safety testing pfizer and moderna are both up for full approval now,1
theres a saying if everyone around you is an asshole then youre the asshole replace asshole with emotionally immature and sound like children and i think you have your reason,1
objectively trumps handling of the pandemic was shambolic at best criminally negligent at worst,1
loooong loooool,1
from my experience they were mostly conservatives and christians not saying that all conservatives and all christians are antivax just that the ones i knew of were all of that ilk,1

given quantum encryption is impossible to break without making it evident i wonder how long until its made a state secretgovernments already dont like strong encryption in the hands of the public even though theyve got back doors into most of the messaging apps so i wonder how theyre going to react when they can no longer snoop conversations without alerting the person to the fact they have done it,1
removed,1
cant bear the thought of eating them it would be like eating puppies,1
what is interesting about this is that trump is the one who pushed the vaccine to begin with and was originally lampooned as attempting something impossible the guy recently put out a big press release again claiming credit for the vaccineits also been fascinating to watch the propaganda and tribalism around this as well as how everyone tries to make this into a political battle its also been frightening to see the censorship and stifling of discussion about the science side effects and long term testing,1

there are four groups of people in this studyprevious infection vaccineprevious infection no vaccineno previous infection vaccineno previous infection no vaccineof the people with no previous infection the vaccine worked well about 97 effective even better than the studies done prior to these vaccines being releasedof the people with previous infection no one got covid again independent of whether or not they received a vaccine this indicates that previous covid infection gives excellent protection against future infection so there is no additional benefit from vaccinating them the 0infinity confidence interval comes from dividing 0 by 0,1
